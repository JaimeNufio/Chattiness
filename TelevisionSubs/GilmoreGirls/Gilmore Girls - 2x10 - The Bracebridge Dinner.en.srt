1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,637
- How do you like that mouth?
- It's not very mouth-like.

2
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,931
- I think it works.
- It's tilted to the side.

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,642
It was intentional.
It gives her a unique expression.

4
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,268
- Like she had a stroke?
- Fine.

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,771
I'll use the Mrs. Potato Head lips.

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,898
No, forget it. Leave Stroke-mouth.

7
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,943
- It's not like we're going to win this.
- Bad attitude.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,572
Mom, face it. That is the single most
incredible snowman I have ever seen.

9
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,367
I'm sorry, that snowman
is way over the top. Too showy.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,119
It's screaming,
'I'm incredible. I'm special. Look at me. '

11
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,914
Kind of the point
of a snowman-building contest.

12
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,043
I hate this man
with every fiber of my being.

13
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,503
- He looks nice.
- He's a ringer.

14
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,629
How do you figure?

15
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,631
Someone promised him
a handsome sum...

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,300
financed his theatrical
snowman accoutrements...

17
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,719
so he could snatch victory
from a deserving local...

18
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,721
in order to bag the contest prize.

19
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:58,934
Seems a little elaborate considering
the prize is a set of new US quarters.

20
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,686
We're ignoring him now.

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,521
What are we doing on your school break?

22
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,981
- A lot of nothing.
- Sounds good.

23
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,316
- Plus some homework.
- And a lot of movies.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,694
We have to rent Godfather llI on DVD.

25
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,696
- You're kidding.
- In the audio commentary...

26
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,782
- Coppola defends casting Sofia.
- That is fatherly love.

27
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,325
What's this homework you have?

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,536
- Just stuff for the paper.
- What? Why?

29
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,497
Paris wants the first issue back
to be a double issue.

30
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,709
So we have to prep over break.
She says the news never sleeps.

31
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,252
Does Paris ever sleep?

32
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,338
I think she periodically makes
a whirring noise and shuts down.

33
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,717
- You can't work the whole time.
- I won't. I promise.

34
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,844
- My God.
- What?

35
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,637
He's power buffing.

36
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,516
Now, that is just wrong.

37
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,394
We're competing against
the Michelangelo of snow.

38
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:45,397
- We're 'Ernest Builds a Snowman. '
- We shouldn't look at him.

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,732
Heads down. Stay focused.

40
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,901
- We can do this.
- Absolutely.

41
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,364
- Let's get some coffee?
- Right behind you.

42
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,846
Yes, you can rent a car in Manhattan
and return it in Hartford.

43
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,848
That's no problem, sir.

44
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,562
Yes, you can return it
to Bradley International.

45
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,440
That's very convenient, or you...

46
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,694
You can... Hold, please.

47
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,241
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

48
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,577
Stop jumping like a Mexican bean.

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,620
Lorelai asked me
to dust the picture frames.

50
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,206
How do you suggest
I clean the tops, smarty?

51
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,670
- I didn't know you could do that.
- Yes, I am miraculously talented.

52
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,756
I thought an alarm would go off,
like in The Thomas Crown Affair.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,802
That would be if this was a museum
and you were a man allowed in museums.

54
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,847
No bickering in the lobby, guys.

55
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,351
Where are we allowed to bicker?

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,353
Got all the mushrooms?
You double-checked?

57
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,772
I've triple-checked. I've quadruple-checked.

58
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,066
The shiitake, the nameko, the chanterelle?

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,570
- Once again, I've got it all.
- The matsutake? The makinia?

60
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,323
- Wait. I don't have makinia.
- You don't have makinia?

61
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,325
- Don't have makinia.
- I made it up.

62
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,702
- You passed the test.
- Don't test me.

63
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,746
The auditions are starting.
You wanna watch?

64
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,206
- Yes.
- Auditions for what?

65
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,124
- Musicians.
- For the Bracebridge dinner.

66
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,168
You guys are going crazy with this dinner.

67
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,587
I told you,
this dinner is not just about food.

68
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,007
We are recreating
an authentic 19th-century meal.

69
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,677
The servers will be in period clothing,
and they'll speak period English.

70
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,763
- Here, look at the costumes.
- Nice.

71
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,640
We're talking seven courses here.

72
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,851
Soup, fish, peacock pie,
the Baron of Beef, the salad...

73
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,937
then the plum pudding, and the wassail.

74
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,314
There's gonna be a big raised platform...

75
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:36,193
where the Squire of Bracebridge
is going to preside over the festivities.

76
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,654
He tastes the foods
and makes pronouncements.

77
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,990
He's the host of the evening,
and his costume is the coolest.

78
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,910
- It all sounds great.
- It is.

79
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,120
By the way,
you're playing Squire Bracebridge.

80
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,580
- Ready?
- Let's go.

81
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,123
What was that?

82
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,542
What are we looking at today?

83
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,420
This is the last on our list. We've got
our trumpets, our madrigal singers.

84
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,923
Sorry, but I'm not playing
Squire Bracebridge.

85
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,260
We've got our servers.
This is for recorder players and harpists.

86
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,303
Hi. Lay some on us, guys.

87
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,396
You cats really know
how to blow those things.

88
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,440
You've got the gig.
I'll call later with the details. Thanks.

89
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,485
Are we clear on this?
I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge.

90
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,529
Sorry you thought that I'd do this.

91
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,490
- When do the guests arrive?
- Thursday at 4:00 on their own jet.

92
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,034
- After buying out the whole inn.
- Nice to have money.

93
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,452
Know what struck me today?

94
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,789
- The fact that I'm not the squire?
- We are crazy for doing this.

95
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:31,874
We are beyond crazy.

96
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,792
We're'Anne Heche speaking to God...

97
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,211
'and looking for the spaceship
in Fresno' crazy.

98
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,214
- Oquinis no-goodo noto.
- II ecnatra dos guidan.

99
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,801
Springing this on me at the last minute,
that's just manipulative.

100
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,136
Sookie, fire.

101
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,306
I got to get back. You'll handle the harp?

102
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,141
- You got it.
- All right, I'll do it.

103
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,810
I'll play Squire Bracebridge
if that's what you want.

104
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,061
Thanks, sweetie.

105
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,398
As long as it's not just because
I fit the costume.

106
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,610
It's because I fit the costume, isn't it?

107
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,944
Go ahead.

108
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,494
- Hi, it's Lorelai.
- Hey, it's me.

109
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,622
Hi, Chris, how are you?

110
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,540
Good. You got a minute?

111
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,169
It's not 'uh, oh. '
I just wanted to run an idea by you.

112
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,212
Run it.

113
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,048
I don't want to step on any plans
you've already made...

114
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,133
but Rory has a school break coming up...

115
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,887
and I was wondering if you'd be cool
with her visiting for a couple of days.

116
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,265
A couple of days?
You mean she'd stay the night?

117
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,851
Yeah, it's totally your call.
Where are you, heaven?

118
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:35,395
Do you even have room
for someone to stay?

119
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,273
Not just room. A room.
A designated guest room.

120
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,193
- Sherry fixed it up really nice.
- Good for her.

121
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,862
- What do you think?
- It's awfully last-minute.

122
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,324
It's totally last-minute. You can say no.
There'll be no hard feelings.

123
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,785
It's really up to Rory to say yes or no.

124
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,913
- You're cool with it?
- Yeah, sure, if Rory is.

125
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,415
That's great. Thank you.

126
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,710
I'll let you run it past her,
and get back to me whenever.

127
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,254
- No pressure.
- No pressure.

128
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,964
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

129
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,715
Talk to you later.

130
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,275
So what are your travel plans, Dad?

131
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,194
You and Mom always go out of town
this time of year.

132
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,322
- Last year it was the Bahamas.
- That's right, it was.

133
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:31,577
I remember you had fun, too.
You said the Bahamamians were real nice.

134
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,621
- The Bahamites? The Bahamamamanians?
- The Bahamians.

135
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,665
- Yes, they were nice.
- They were nice.

136
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,959
So what are your plans?

137
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,045
- We're not going anywhere this year.
- Why not?

138
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,093
Well, it can be really nice
just to stay at home...

139
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,889
because you can do fun things
that you normally wouldn't have time for.

140
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,767
Yeah, like play Running Charades
and get out that Slip 'N Slide.

141
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,604
- We'll see.
- Yes, we'll see.

142
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:01,773
Would you all excuse me?
I have to make some calls.

143
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,902
- Say goodbye before you leave, will you?
- Sure, Dad.

144
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,449
When is this awfulness with work
gonna resolve itself?

145
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,868
I don't know. The man is so sensitive.

146
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,871
He reads so much
into every little perceived slight.

147
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,791
I remember when I was a kid,
Dad had put on some weight...

148
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,294
and he bought a new suit
to try to cover it up.

149
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,671
He wore it for us and said,
'How do I look?'

150
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,632
I said, 'You look fat. '

151
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:32,429
I guess that wasn't really
a perceived slight.

152
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,391
I'll think of another example.

153
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,979
Keep in mind, at the Bracebridge dinner,
we are not just servers.

154
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,356
We are performers.

155
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:47,110
Any time you're with a guest, you must be
in character and must speak Old English.

156
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,197
It's a world we're creating here,
so whatever we can do...

157
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,574
Kirk, you're driving me crazy.

158
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,951
Who, me?

159
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,663
'Whatever we can do to...
Kirk, you're driving me crazy. '

160
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,122
Me. Sorry.

161
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,542
Guys, look at the materials I gave you.

162
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,628
Tell me, if a guest asks you
how the food's coming...

163
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,589
what would be the appropriate
Old English response?

164
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,759
'Greetings. '

165
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,554
- You just read the first thing on the list.
- Maybe.

166
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,722
Guys, the correct response:

167
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,934
'Our ovens, they with baked meat choke. '

168
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,477
- Question.
- Yes?

169
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,980
What color dress will I be wearing
when I say this?

170
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,607
- Don't be an idiot.
- This is stupid.

171
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,444
Shut up and pay attention to Sookie.
She worked very hard to bring this about.

172
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,281
But unfortunately,
we don't all share intimacies with her...

173
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,157
so she doesn't cut us any slack.

174
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,159
She doesn't treat me differently.

175
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,788
She's called you 'Peaches' three times.
It's all in the transcript.

176
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,208
Instead of talking Old English,
can I talk like an old man?

177
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,544
- What?
- You kids, get off my lawn!

178
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:48,505
No, you cannot just talk like an old man.

179
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,883
Honey, what's the matter?

180
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,051
- They're snowed in.
- Who's snowed in?

181
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:56,555
The Bracebridge group.
They're stuck in Chicago. The dinner's off.

182
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,973
- No.
- Yes.

183
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,224
I'm gonna cry.

184
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,352
I offered to fund the invention
of a molecular transport device...

185
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,562
but they didn't go for it.

186
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,940
That makes me so mad. And so sad.

187
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,942
- I'm smad.
- Sookie?

188
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:13,655
Does this mean that my pockets
willeth not with money get choked?

189
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,825
That sounded like Old English. Cool.

190
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,912
I've got 30 pounds of aged beef...

191
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:23,248
trays and trays of trout,
mountains of prune tarts.

192
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,419
I diced pumpkins until my hands
turned orange. I've got pumpkin hands.

193
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,922
- Take a sip.
- How can you stay so calm about this?

194
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,966
- There's nothing we can do.
- I can't believe they got snowed in.

195
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,928
All that work. All that extra help we hired.

196
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,348
At least they paid for it already.
We didn't lose any money.

197
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,768
I guess. I could still make up
the dinner for the three of us.

198
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,396
Then it would be the three of us
all alone in the dining room.

199
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,150
Like The Shining, except
instead of Jack Nicholson, we have Rune.

200
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,236
You girls want anything besides coffee?

201
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,279
- What about Luke?
- What about him?

202
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,365
He eats, and Jess eats.

203
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,116
- Doesn't Jess eat?
- What's she doing?

204
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,452
I think she's inviting you for dinner.

205
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:04,206
Yeah, come on, join us. It'll be fun.
You like peacock pie?

206
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,042
- I'm 100% sure I don't.
- There'll be normal food, too.

207
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,502
- And decorations.
- And music.

208
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,420
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- Well...

209
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:13,298
You know what? Let's invite everyone.

210
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,425
- Everyone who?
- Everyone everyone.

211
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,595
- Everyone everyone who?
- Everyone we know. Everyone we like.

212
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,430
They can even stay in the Inn.

213
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,808
All those empty rooms,
those uneaten pillow mints.

214
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,185
An out-of-control,
over-the-top slumber party.

215
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,479
- I love it!
- Done. Spread the word.

216
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,981
I haven't said I'd come yet...

217
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,234
so I'm certainly not gonna
suddenly become your messenger boy.

218
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,485
- 8:00?
- 7:00.

219
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:34,570
Right.

220
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,451
Are you going to this big shindig
at the Inn tonight?

221
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,037
I'm just trying to trick my mom
into not going with me.

222
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:47,166
- How's that coming along?
- How's that Pixies reunion coming along?

223
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,877
- I'll see you and your mom there.
- Bye.

224
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,671
Keep it up and you'll get hurt.

225
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,383
Hey, guys! Come on. Break it up.

226
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,926
Quit! Hold it! Get off me!

227
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,054
Get off me, man! I'm not fighting you.

228
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,514
Jess, knock it off.

229
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,684
What the hell is your problem?
You saw it was me.

230
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,061
- Why'd you keep punching?
- I had momentum.

231
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,396
I was trying to help you.

232
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,191
I don't need your help,
but thanks for offering.

233
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,944
- Did Bootsy R.S.V. P?
- Yeah, he's coming.

234
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,531
- Thanks. Is he bringing anybody?
- He's coming solo.

235
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,285
- I'm gonna put him in Room 16 with Luke.
- You can't do that.

236
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,537
- Let me have my fun.
- Luke's coming with Jess.

237
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,498
I'll put Jess in with Miss Patty.

238
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,292
- There'll be no Jess left in the morning.
- You stink.

239
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,212
- Are these last year's cards or this year's?
- This year's.

240
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,839
Don't scoff.
Last year's set was here till Halloween.

241
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,468
If that's a crack at my housekeeping skills,
then okay.

242
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,386
- Wow.
- What?

243
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,139
This is one ugly-looking baby.
Whose baby is this?

244
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:48,060
- That's your second cousin Stan's poor kid.
- He got Stan's everything.

245
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,396
- That's not the ugliest baby in the bunch.
- You're kidding.

246
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,732
That's the ugliest baby in the bunch.

247
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:55,776
Why do people put pictures on cards?

248
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,612
Do they not understand
we are unapologetic mockers?

249
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,698
There's an unexplained innocence
in the world.

250
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,700
- I didn't see this.
- See what?

251
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:04,826
Dad.

252
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,456
- The woman, I'm assuming, is Sherry.
- Did I not show you that?

253
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,084
They've got a cute little puppy
and everything.

254
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:15,587
I must've put it in the stack
and forgotten to tell you about it.

255
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,090
- There it is.
- Nice-looking lady.

256
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,008
Like a young Tammy Faye Bakker.

257
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,011
- But prettier than that.
- I didn't mean not pretty.

258
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:26,807
Question about the room list.
Room 31, why is it empty?

259
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,101
- I wanted to run an idea by you.
- Run it.

260
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,479
I thought maybe a certain depressed man
and his wife could stay there.

261
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,940
- Woody and Soon-Yi?
- Grandma and Grandpa.

262
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,693
- You've got to be kidding.
- This could cheer him up.

263
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,445
I'll send him a Def Jam comedy tape.
That'll cheer him up.

264
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,156
- It's a good thing to do.
- We'll donate money to charity.

265
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,868
That's a good thing, too.
We'll stop kicking dogs.

266
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,412
I'll pencil them in,
but they'll probably say no.

267
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,039
But we're not gonna hope
that they say no, right?

268
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,458
- Right.
- Because that would be really bad karma...

269
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,836
especially on top of making fun
of the ugly babies.

270
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,424
I have a New Year's resolution for you.
Become more cynical and self-absorbed.

271
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,967
I'll work on it.

272
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:09,183
- How's Sookie doing in there?
- She's paper-bagging it.

273
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,726
- What?
- You know...

274
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,353
So she's right on schedule.

275
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,731
- Hey, dolls.
- Welcome.

276
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,816
- Are we the first ones here?
- Yes, you are.

277
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,820
Now, don't you freak out.
Morey hates being the first anywhere.

278
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,323
He thinks it hurts his street credibility.

279
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:28,994
- Charlie Parker was late to everything.
- He had more drugs in him than a Rite Aid.

280
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,372
- Forget Charlie Parker.
- You two are in Room 8. It's ready for you.

281
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,416
Thanks, doll. Come on, Morey.

282
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,336
We could be late for dinner
if it'll make you feel better.

283
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,670
A little.

284
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,882
- Are you alone?
- Lane.

285
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:44,718
My wedding night's
gonna be very interesting.

286
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:48,347
I'm glad you guys could come.
You guys are in Room 12.

287
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,475
Thank you. Hello, Lorelai.
Thank you for inviting us.

288
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,269
Our pleasure.
Do you need help bringing in your stuff?

289
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,772
This is my stuff.
Don't need any more stuff.

290
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,399
- People have too much stuff.
- You know, you're right.

291
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,860
People have too much stuff. Absolutely.

292
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:07,115
- Says the woman with 64 pairs of shoes.
- Thus proving my point.

293
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,076
What is Paris doing here?

294
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,871
She had to bring me the newspaper
stuff tonight. She couldn't wait.

295
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,165
Robot, she's a robot. Hi.

296
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,459
Here are the materials
on the double issue.

297
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,045
Some of the articles
will need complete re-writes.

298
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,965
Madeline's 500 words on test anxiety
spends 400 of them...

299
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:26,385
arguing that stretch corduroy
is the best material for low-rise jeans.

300
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:29,304
Well, let's see. Corduroy is a fabric.

301
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,976
The fabric of society is weakened
when students...

302
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,895
- You can't get there.
- It doesn't look like it.

303
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,356
- I'll get on this tomorrow.
- What about tonight?

304
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,400
- I'm busy tonight.
- Doing what?

305
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,026
Well, this.

306
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,322
- What is this?
- It's kind of a big dinner party.

307
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:52,035
I'll get out of your way.
Call if you need to talk things through.

308
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,705
She uses the Prince version of writing.

309
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:58,584
A letter 'U' for 'you'
and a picture of an eye for an 'I.'

310
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,631
- Do you have anything going on tonight?
- What's that supposed to mean?

311
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,800
It means, do you have anything
going on tonight?

312
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:10,387
My parents are out of town,
so my Portuguese nanny will make dinner.

313
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,766
Then I'll get back to reading The lliad
or we'll play Monopoly. I always crush her.

314
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,102
I was thinking
you may want to stay for dinner.

315
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,229
- Here?
- Yeah. We have a ton of food...

316
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,524
and it's a whole big show.
If you're not doing anything...

317
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,402
Rereading The lliad a third time
is not 'not doing anything. '

318
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,196
- I'm not pathetic.
- I know you're not.

319
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,241
- I just thought it might be fun, that's all.
- I'll have to make a call.

320
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:34,411
- Good, make it.
- I just have to let Nanny know.

321
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:44,129
- Hey.
- Hello, there.

322
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,176
Hey, Clara.
Nice. Is that a Stella McCartney?

323
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,553
- It's a Wal-Mart.
- Well, it's very pretty.

324
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,181
- My mom bought it for tonight.
- She's got good taste.

325
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,475
- I didn't know he was coming.
- Who?

326
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,810
- Jess.
- Yeah. Is that a problem?

327
00:16:58,894 --> 00:16:59,978
Not really.

328
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,482
It's just that he got into this fight
with this guy at school.

329
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,318
- When I broke it up, he started in on me.
- He hit you?

330
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,362
- He tried.
- Why would he do that?

331
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,864
Don't ask me to explain that jerk.

332
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,660
He'd better not do that all night.

333
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,162
No! It tastes too 20th-century, guys.

334
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,666
It's got to shout, 'Washington Irving! '
Not, 'Irving, my accountant. '

335
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,252
It needs something. Help me. What is it?

336
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,547
- What?
- Rune naked, naked Rune.

337
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,758
These stupid pants
won't go past my thighs.

338
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,511
- Why are you dressing in here?
- The bathrooms are full...

339
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,430
and the madrigal singers
are bogarting the supply closet.

340
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,682
This is the only place.

341
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,268
- They're too small.
- My thighs are too big.

342
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:44,398
In lieu of coming up with something
to reduce the size of your thighs...

343
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,441
why don't we
get you a bigger pair of pants?

344
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,694
- And a different place to dress.
- Definitely.

345
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,613
- Can you get me the supply closet?
- We'll take it by force.

346
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:53,991
Go. Oh, God.

347
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,788
- Is everything under control?
- Yeah.

348
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:03,876
No. This needs something,
and I cannot think of what it is.

349
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:08,881
It's that tart, kind of spicy, white... Salt!

350
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,675
- The word is 'salt'!
- You forgot the word for 'salt'?

351
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,011
- Everything's under control.
- Good.

352
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,431
- Absolutely, 100%.
- You're exuding confidence.

353
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,476
- Have the oxygen ready.
- Easy. It's a bird.

354
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,401
- They're here.
- Who?

355
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,652
The Joyless Luck Club.

356
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:33,572
Hello, girls.
You look particularly lovely tonight.

357
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,948
Thanks, Grandpa.

358
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,742
You guys look nice yourselves.

359
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,785
Seems like the occasion called for it.

360
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,413
The air seems crisper here than Hartford.
It's wonderful.

361
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:44,625
Dad, you didn't grab
the wrong prescription bottle, did you?

362
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,959
- What?
- Nothing.

363
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,420
I think she was making
one of her funny jokes.

364
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,465
- Went straight over my head.
- Let me get someone to help you.

365
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,258
No, just point me to the room.

366
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,345
You guys are in Room 31.
Best room in the place.

367
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:59,765
Anything's fine. I'll see you in a bit.

368
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,896
- What got into him?
- He's totally different.

369
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,981
I know. He's been that way for two days.

370
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,151
I have no idea why,
but I'm taking the credit.

371
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,616
A hostess's job is never done. Hi.

372
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,928
Everybody, will you gather round?

373
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,181
Everyone. First, I want to welcome you...

374
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,934
to the first annual
and probably never to be held again...

375
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:46,812
as Sookie's close to a nervous breakdown,
Bracebridge dinner.

376
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,689
I'm fine. Everything's fine.

377
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:53,360
I also thank Mother Nature for snowing in
the Trelling Paper Company in Chicago...

378
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,446
so I could throw this great party
for all my friends instead.

379
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,240
It's a very special night, so...

380
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,910
since I don't get to eat
unbelievably strange food...

381
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,122
with my friends every day,
I've arranged a little surprise.

382
00:20:05,164 --> 00:20:08,542
Outside, as we speak,
is a line of horse-drawn sleighs...

383
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,335
and everybody gets a ride.

384
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:16,675
So line up and keep it orderly.
There's two per sleigh.

385
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,303
No cutting in front of each other.
That goes for all.

386
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,931
Except me, 'cause I'll be damned
if I miss a ride in a horse-drawn sleigh.

387
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:26,059
- You gonna go?
- I think I'll wait for the clog dancing.

388
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:29,396
- Don't move.
- We're gonna miss all the good horses.

389
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,274
Who is this brazen woman
competing for your attention?

390
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,525
Come on!

391
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:36,403
- I guess I'm spoken for.
- I'll see you back here.

392
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,911
You see the horses?

393
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,456
You mean the ones three feet
from my face? Yeah. I saw them.

394
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:49,791
I spent a summer
training horses in Montana.

395
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,211
You get kicked in the head a lot?

396
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,048
- Just the once.
- Hey, you in the belt, get in.

397
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,968
No, I was just sort of checking things out.

398
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:03,013
Come on. We could pull a Ben-Hur
and take down Taylor's sleigh.

399
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,557
- I don't know.
- Come on, Luke.

400
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,769
I can't be all schoolmarmy
and ride by myself. Please?

401
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,229
Well, okay.

402
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,694
Giddyap.

403
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,325
The horses heard me.
I speak horse language. I'm Dr. Dolittle.

404
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,578
Plus, I think the driver of the sleigh
heard you.

405
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,251
I gotta say, sleigh rides are a little much,
but these horses are beautiful.

406
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,962
- Especially from this angle.
- Not just from this angle.

407
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,923
Seriously. Don't backtrack.
Horse has got a nice butt there.

408
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,050
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Nice firm heinie.

409
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,719
Stop talking about the horse's heinie.

410
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:46,849
The town looks beautiful.

411
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,059
- Same as always.
- No...

412
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:52,020
it's always different this time of year.
It's magical.

413
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,605
If you say so, sure.

414
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,941
There's the magical
plumbing supply store...

415
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,402
where I bought a magical float
for my toilet.

416
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,988
- You disappoint me.
- Look, the magical Luke's Diner...

417
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,448
right below the apartment
that Jess magically lit...

418
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,952
- by leaving every stinking light on.
- How's it going with you guys?

419
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,496
- Me and Jess? Great.
- Great? Really?

420
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,499
- Well, good.
- It is good.

421
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,961
I mean, it was hard at first,
seemed impossible, you know...

422
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,881
but I've learned a lot
these last couple of months.

423
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:22,342
- Like?
- Like last week...

424
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:25,971
- I discovered the secret of parenting.
- You did?

425
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,183
- The secret of parenting?
- The secret of parenting.

426
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,977
- When last week? Last Tuesday?
- I don't know the exact day.

427
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,688
Tuesday at 5:15?
Is that when you discovered it?

428
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,981
Don't mock.

429
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:38,483
Well, tell me. What is...

430
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,945
- Wait. It's a secret. You can't tell me.
- No, I'll tell you.

431
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:46,033
- You visualize the reality you want.
- Visualize the reality you want.

432
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,495
And then if necessary,
you lie to bring it about.

433
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,955
That is so much worse
than I was expecting.

434
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,832
You never lied to your kid?

435
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,169
To save her from great physical pain, yes.

436
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,506
When she was little and she'd play
in the kitchen, I told her...

437
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:02,508
the burners were the deviI's hands.

438
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,510
I'd say it in a scary evangelist voice.

439
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:07,471
'Don't touch the deviI's hands. '
She still doesn't go near it.

440
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,599
Exactly. You told a white lie
for your kid's protection...

441
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,602
- very similar to what I have done.
- Which was?

442
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:15,812
- You know the winter break is coming.
- I do.

443
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,315
It means Jess has
some time off from school.

444
00:23:18,357 --> 00:23:20,567
His mom knew that, and she never called.

445
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,152
That makes me sick.

446
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:25,322
So I decided to keep Jess with me.
I told him...

447
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:27,449
that his mom wanted him to come home.

448
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,327
But since he just got there
and he was still adjusting...

449
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:33,497
that I thought he should stay.
His mom was really upset...

450
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,375
but I insisted.
He bought it hook, line, and sinker.

451
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,377
Saved him a lot of hurt.

452
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,549
- He didn't buy it.
- What? Of course he did.

453
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,219
He knows.

454
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,809
I wish Lorelai had warned us about this.

455
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:56,937
- What? This is wonderful.
- It's wreaking havoc with my hair.

456
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,982
This is not bad for your hair,
compared to the other thing.

457
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:01,400
What other thing?

458
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:04,194
Richard, stop it!

459
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:07,072
- Suddenly you're two years old.
- I'm just having fun.

460
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,908
- I'm not complaining.
- This is fun, too.

461
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,995
- This is like a roller coaster.
- A little.

462
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:15,831
Say, when was the last time
we were on a roller coaster?

463
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,916
- Never.
- Didn't we ever go to Coney Island?

464
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,960
That must have been your other wife.

465
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,045
I used to love it when I was a kid.

466
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,048
- They were a lot faster then, too.
- And less safe.

467
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,341
We should go on one.

468
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:27,968
- What?
- A fast one.

469
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,846
You go, and I'll wait
and hold your cotton candy for you.

470
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,056
- You are going.
- It would take a whole day.

471
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:34,975
- You are going.
- I'd be scared.

472
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,810
I'll hold your hand.

473
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:40,063
- Fine. We'll go on a roller coaster.
- Good.

474
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,066
Where is this roller coaster
we're going on?

475
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,484
I'm not sure.

476
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:47,821
I'll get Rory to look it up
on the Internet for us.

477
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,409
- That it, miss?
- I guess I'm alone.

478
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,334
What are you doing?

479
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,128
I heard it was two to a sleigh,
no more, no less.

480
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,839
- You're breaking the rules.
- You could've hurt yourself.

481
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,175
I live on the edge.
I could jump out if you want.

482
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,011
- It doesn't matter to me.
- You mad at me or something?

483
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,972
- What do you think?
- I can't read your mind.

484
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,558
- You got into a fight with Dean.
- Dean?

485
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,018
My boyfriend.

486
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,687
- He's still your boyfriend?
- You can jump out now.

487
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:22,689
I wasn't fighting him. It was someone else.

488
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:25,275
- He jumped in on his own.
- He was trying to help you.

489
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,445
He should go into government service
if he likes helping people.

490
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,155
But me, he can stop worrying about.

491
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:33,867
- Why were you fighting in the first place?
- 'Cause Chuck Presby's a jerk.

492
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,954
You were fighting Chuck Presby?
He is a jerk.

493
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:40,332
This whole town is weird and full of jerks.

494
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,460
- Then why are you still here?
- What do you mean?

495
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,506
I mean, schooI's out. You don't like it here,
so why don't you just go home?

496
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,132
My mom didn't want me to.

497
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,927
- I don't believe that.
- That's your right, I guess.

498
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,346
Did Luke say she didn't want you to?

499
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,516
Luke told me it was his idea
that I should stay.

500
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,644
It wasn't his idea.

501
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,982
- That's good.
- What?

502
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,317
Your snowman. Snowwoman, actually.

503
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,696
- You know which one's ours?
- It definitely has the most personality.

504
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:14,366
- Kind of looks like BjÖrk.
- That's what we were going for.

505
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,119
Everyone thinks the one on the end
will be the winner.

506
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,872
- Really? It's so overdone.
- I agree.

507
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:22,124
- You should win.
- No argument.

508
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,879
- What do you and Dean talk about?
- What?

509
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,006
I mean, does he know BjÖrk?

510
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,175
I've played him some stuff.

511
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,052
So you got a teacher-student thing going.

512
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,638
- Stop.
- No, really, I'm curious.

513
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:38,891
- What do you guys talk about?
- Everything.

514
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:42,394
- Like...
- Everything. Tons of stuff. Whatever.

515
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:45,898
It's just that in the brief,
non-pugilistic time I've spent with him...

516
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,609
he just doesn't seem like your kind of guy.

517
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:52,613
Well, he is my kind of guy.
He's exactly my kind of guy.

518
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:56,867
- Guess I don't know him that well.
- You don't.

519
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,707
Quiet, please, everybody.

520
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:07,252
Before the button-popping
and the bloating can commence...

521
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:09,713
- say 'cheese. '
- Cheese.

522
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:15,427
Ladies and gentlemen,
Damen und Herren...

523
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:18,180
the moment you've been waiting for.

524
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,099
I give you the Bracebridge dinner.

525
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:24,394
Hold it.
We just need a quick minute, please.

526
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:28,440
Which will be starting in one quick minute.

527
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,652
Ever think about that?
You can't have a quick minute...

528
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:34,363
- because it's always 60 seconds.
- Shut up.

529
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:38,283
Lorelai, darling, who is the silver fox
with the tight knee socks?

530
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,078
That's Claude.
He's one of our regular servers.

531
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,374
- Divorced and on the market.
- The uniform is interesting.

532
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:48,293
I'll have him bathed, powdered,
and sent to your room.

533
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,796
What? You joke?

534
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:53,298
Was that a joke?

535
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:56,510
Lorelai, this is just beautiful.

536
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,846
It's like something
out of Architectural Digest.

537
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,889
- You should be very proud.
- Thanks, Dad.

538
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:03,684
- Your dress needs pressing.
- Thanks, Mom.

539
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,563
Your pod grandpa's still happy as a clam.

540
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:10,607
- I told you this would be good.
- When you're right, you're right.

541
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,485
Welcome, lords and ladies.

542
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:17,614
I call upon these sprightly horns
to commence our proceedings.

543
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,457
Chuck Mangione,
you want to back up a step?

544
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,500
And we're off.

545
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:32,921
And now, fair people,
I present my lord and master...

546
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,507
the honorable Squire Bracebridge.

547
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:47,769
Lo! Now has come our joyfullest feast.

548
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,855
Let every man be jolly.

549
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:53,317
We should have eaten before we came.

550
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:58,447
Humble servant, bring us
the first course to dine with pleasure.

551
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,491
Methinks it be a butternut squash soup.

552
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,993
Methinks you're right, Squire.
Thus and verily.

553
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,036
And verily thus.

554
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,497
They're the Old England
Abbott and Costello.

555
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,999
'Tis perfection, but extremely hot.

556
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,294
My lord, you need aid.
Wouldst thou have thee ice thy tongue?

557
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:16,006
Nay, Rune.
To the guests, thou shalt serve the soup!

558
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,721
- What's the white stuff?
- I think it's cheese or cream.

559
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:26,099
- And the green stuff?
- I think it's best picked off.

560
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:30,479
- No one says grace?
- I think they all do, Mama. Silently.

561
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,067
- Did you say silent grace?
- Good one.

562
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,406
Soup for my ladies?

563
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,535
- Why, thank you, kind sir.
- Hey, Kirk, nice blouse.

564
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,912
Don't let her make fun of you.
You look great.

565
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,832
Soup with garlands gay, and rosemary.

566
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:52,459
You're gonna stay in character
no matter what.

567
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:55,295
It is hot, so proceed daintily.

568
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:59,174
Did you ever see that I love Lucy
where she goes to Buckingham Palace?

569
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,845
She tries to get the palace guard
to break character. That was funny.

570
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:05,264
- 'Tis foreign to me, good lady.
- Hang in there.

571
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,391
The ones when she was in Europe
were the best.

572
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:11,395
- No way, the Hollywood ones. Damn!
- I was rooting for you, boy.

573
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:21,613
My lord, shall dessert be served?

574
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:23,782
Anon, humble servant.

575
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:28,620
- Can I eat my dessert with the horses?
- Sure, but put your coat on.

576
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:32,416
Are you okay?

577
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:36,420
I guess so. I've lost track
of how many beers I've had.

578
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,005
Seven.

579
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:41,842
- Paris, how's it going?
- Fine. Good.

580
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:43,927
- Thanks for having me.
- It was our pleasure.

581
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:45,971
- Did you notice the anachronisms?
- The what?

582
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,682
The period discrepancies.
They were pretty blatant.

583
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:51,768
Forget that the 19th century
didn't include recessed lighting...

584
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:53,979
or the Fossil watch
your server was wearing.

585
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:57,316
But water in that period would not
have been served with cubed ice.

586
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,651
Your servers are wearing
nylon blend shirts.

587
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:02,654
Nylon was invented by a scientist
at DuPont in the 1920s.

588
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,781
It shattered the illusion.

589
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:07,159
Floggings will be administered.

590
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:11,163
So there we are,
it's a beautiful moonlit Prague night...

591
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:13,707
and we're strolling across
the Charles Bridge...

592
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,709
when we come across this group of kids...

593
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:19,004
blasting this song by that awful woman.

594
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:20,714
Who is she? The tall, bony one...

595
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:23,967
married to the deceased
mustachioed Congressman.

596
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,302
- Cher?
- That's the one.

597
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,429
The year of
Do you believe in life after love?

598
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:28,805
A difficult time for all of us.

599
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,350
- I like that song.
- I was appalled.

600
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:34,770
Prague has played host to some
of the greatest composers in history.

601
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:38,815
Mozart named a symphony after it,
for heaven's sake. So what did I do?

602
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:43,403
- I've tried so hard to forget this.
- I stood beside them and their boom box...

603
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:47,074
and I hummed Mozart's Prague Symphony
as loud as I could.

604
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,914
- The bizarro Battle of the Bands.
- And did it work?

605
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:56,667
They quickly packed up
and went their way.

606
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,628
But then he kept on humming the Mozart.
He wouldn't stop.

607
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,507
I was hoping for some gullible tourists
to drop money at my feet.

608
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:05,884
- Two of them did.
- And I kept it!

609
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:10,722
This might be the most interesting
conversation I've ever had...

610
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,724
- with an insurance man.
- I'm hurt.

611
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:14,726
I'm sorry. What I meant was that...

612
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,981
What you meant was that people
in the insurance industry are drones.

613
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:23,360
I agree. They are a dull lot,
and I am glad to be rid of them.

614
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:25,946
Rid of them?

615
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:28,323
Are you retired, Richard?

616
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,161
Of course he's not. Richard?

617
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,582
Actually, I am.

618
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,470
It's nice to end a big, festive meal with
a big festive pall hanging over the room.

619
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,723
- Most people didn't notice anything.
- Yeah.

620
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:56,101
I guess Bootsy singing Hotel California
accompanied by spoons...

621
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:57,769
drew people's attention away.

622
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:00,898
Did Grandma and Grandpa
say a word to each other after that?

623
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:02,107
Why didn't he tell anyone?

624
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:04,985
Are you asking me
to interpret my parents' motives?

625
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:07,196
My mistake. So which bed do you want?

626
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,698
- Take the one by the window.
- Okay.

627
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,452
- Mom!
- What, honey?

628
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:15,787
You put the ugly baby's picture in my bed.

629
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,456
I didn't. I swear.

630
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,583
That ugly baby is stalking us. Run away.

631
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,002
- Poor baby. It's not his fault.
- I think it's a she.

632
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,796
Poor baby. You picked the wrong parents.

633
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:28,425
Have you heard from Dad recently?

634
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,304
- What dad? Your dad?
- Yeah, my dad.

635
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:33,472
Why?

636
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:36,808
Because he's my dad, and he usually
checks in this time of year...

637
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:40,312
and he hasn't checked in yet.
I know he's probably busy with Sherry...

638
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,439
and the new apartment... What?

639
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,316
There may have been a call.

640
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,443
There may have been?
You don't remember?

641
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:49,488
Things have been so hectic
with the Bracebridge dinner...

642
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:53,200
and building a snowwoman. And planning
the ugly baby gag, that took time.

643
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:54,993
- Mom...
- Yes, he called.

644
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:58,288
He called and invited you
and it's not too late to go.

645
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,376
He called and invited you. There you go.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, so there.

646
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,837
- He invited me over?
- Yes, are you deaf?

647
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:07,840
No, I'm trying to separate the gist
from the...

648
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:11,176
- The gist is he invited you.
- Why didn't he invite me himself?

649
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,054
He's pretending to be considerate
by running it past me first.

650
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,349
Was he maybe not pretending
and actually being considerate?

651
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:20,185
Maybe. But I wouldn't put it past him
to be inconsiderate.

652
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:23,188
- He doesn't have a great track record.
- Why didn't you tell me?

653
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,732
He may be waiting for my answer,
holding off his plans.

654
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:29,778
Because I have dibs on this time of year
with you. Not him, me.

655
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:32,948
He acknowledged that
and that was cool, but still, it stinks.

656
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,617
Because he put me
in a very difficult position.

657
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:39,204
We were supposed to watch a lot
of movies and make fun of Godfather III.

658
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,707
The thing that I really hate about this...

659
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,377
is the idea of you not hanging out with me
'cause you're hanging out there...

660
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,588
with your stupid stepmother.

661
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:50,549
- You're calling Sherry my stepmother?
- She practically is.

662
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:53,051
- You're wigging.
- There's something wrong with her.

663
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,596
- You don't even know her.
- You think I'm overreacting?

664
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,307
- I think you're jealous of Sherry.
- I'm not jealous.

665
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,851
But I understand.
Your territory has been threatened.

666
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,436
- Excuse me?
- Relax.

667
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,523
There are ways to work through these
situations. Compromises can be struck.

668
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:09,776
- What are you saying?
- I can still call you 'Mom'...

669
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,738
- and I'll call her 'Mommy Sherry. '
- Don't be mean.

670
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:16,617
We can split up holidays evenly.
Like I'll be with you on Labor Day...

671
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,868
- her on Memorial Day.
- Enough.

672
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,536
I'll have to find out her religion...

673
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,413
to see how Hanukkah will factor into this.

674
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:24,541
Unless you want to convert to Judaism,
take Hanukkah for yourself.

675
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,919
I get the point. I overreacted. Please stop.

676
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,546
You totally overreacted. God.

677
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,428
You think you're gonna go
and stay with them?

678
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,554
I'll think about it.

679
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,723
Do you have to think
because it's killing me...

680
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:42,309
not to know your plans,
and you want to torture me?

681
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,895
Nope. I just don't know if I want to do it.

682
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:49,316
- It was nice of him to ask, though.
- It was very nice.

683
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:52,277
- 'Cause we are rooting for Dad.
- We are rooting for him.

684
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:56,114
It was a very nice thing
that Christopher offered.

685
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:58,033
I was being a little possessive.

686
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,244
And insanely jealous
of his pretty girlfriend.

687
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,246
I want to know
if she's good enough for him.

688
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,330
Me, too.

689
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,666
So there was an altruistic streak
to my madness.

690
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:07,417
I'll go with that.

691
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:13,382
I need a new room.

692
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,801
- What?
- I can't stay in that room.

693
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:19,346
- There are no other rooms.
- Then I'll go home.

694
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,348
- Grandma, it's late.
- And pitch black.

695
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:24,935
- The roads are icy. You can't drive.
- I'm not going back to that room.

696
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,020
You and Dad had it out
about the job thing?

697
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:30,274
We haven't even spoken. I'm so upset
I wouldn't know where to start.

698
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:33,861
I couldn't take being around him anymore.
What he did is inexcusable.

699
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:37,447
Not letting me know he left his job,
as if it didn't affect me.

700
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:41,326
Mom, try to calm down.
Take this bed, and Rory and I will share.

701
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:44,246
- I'm just a burden.
- You're not a burden, Mom.

702
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,957
Okay. Thank you.

703
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,585
Can I use the mirror in the bathroom
for a second?

704
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,712
Yes. I'll use the one out here.

705
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:06,268
- What?
- Behold my future.

706
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:13,817
- How do you turn off the light?
- I'll get it.

707
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,987
I still can't believe it.

708
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,655
Try to relax, Mom.

709
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:21,825
I hope he doesn't sleep,
because I surely won't.

710
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:25,746
These slippers you have here
are hardly one size fits all.

711
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:27,998
- They're too big.
- Good night.

712
00:37:34,004 --> 00:37:35,964
It was so irresponsible.

713
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,509
Maybe he had no choice.

714
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:41,678
Of course he had a choice.
Go to sleep, Lorelai.

715
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,056
That job was killing him, Mom.

716
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:46,767
It was killing him.

717
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:57,945
I'm going for a little walk.

718
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:00,614
- Grandma, it's late.
- I'm not tired.

719
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:07,704
Like sands through the hourglass,
so are the Gilmores of our lives.

720
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,632
- I didn't know you were here.
- Emily, don't go.

721
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:21,802
- I'm very tired.
- I want to talk to you. Please.

722
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:35,607
I don't need to remind you
about how I've been feeling at work.

723
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:38,777
My frustration
just built to the point where...

724
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,405
Again, you know this.

725
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:47,369
So I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday
just to talk about the situation...

726
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,955
and about the rumors I had heard
floating around.

727
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:53,292
So I met with Floyd.
We shook hands, had coffee...

728
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:57,087
and then I started telling him
about how unhappy I'd become.

729
00:38:57,796 --> 00:39:01,884
I detailed all my years with the company,
all the travel I'd done...

730
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,803
all the weekends I'd put in,
the sacrifices I had made...

731
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,431
including time with my family,
for the firm.

732
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:10,267
The more I talked, the angrier I became.

733
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:14,021
And then, suddenly, I heard myself resign.

734
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,523
Just like that.

735
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:19,943
Floyd was stunned.

736
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:23,030
I'd never seen Floyd stunned.

737
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,991
I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned.

738
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:29,995
So I finished my coffee
and I walked out of that office...

739
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,498
and I couldn't believe what I had just done.

740
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,249
I'd resigned, quit.

741
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,211
I believe I even used a little profanity
in the process.

742
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,421
But do you know what, Emily?

743
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,258
I was thrilled, elated.

744
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,678
A giant weight
had been lifted off my chest.

745
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,974
I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me...

746
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:53,936
and I realized
it was because I was smiling.

747
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:58,023
Nobody had seen me smile there
in a very long time.

748
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,442
I was happy.

749
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,195
And you chose not to tell me,
your own wife?

750
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,325
I know I've done nothing but
disappoint you these past few months...

751
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,327
what with how isolated I've become...

752
00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:12,913
and all the social engagements
I've made you cancel...

753
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,541
and all the friendships I've jeopardized.

754
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:18,252
And you like order. You like lists.

755
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,338
You like to know where you're going
or what's coming.

756
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:25,217
You like all things planned.
And then suddenly...

757
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,929
I impulsively unplan our entire future
in one fell swoop.

758
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:31,682
I couldn't face disappointing you again.

759
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:35,269
I couldn't face telling you
that I had spoiled the plan.

760
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:37,896
Not now, not at this time of year.

761
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:42,192
I didn't want to fight.
I didn't want to worry.

762
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:46,071
I just wanted to keep being happy.

763
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:50,409
I'm very sorry.

764
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:55,289
Anyhow...

765
00:40:56,915 --> 00:41:00,711
I've been sitting here
going over our financial situation.

766
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:04,214
Now, we still have
all our retirement accounts...

767
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:06,341
and our medical coverage is all there.

768
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:10,053
By quitting, we do forego some
of my pension and some stock options.

769
00:41:10,137 --> 00:41:13,098
Not a terribly significant amount,
but an amount all the same.

770
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:17,352
Let's just go to bed.

771
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:33,494
- See you, Bootsy.
- See you. Thanks.

772
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,623
By the way, last night,
did I sing Hotel California?

773
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:40,250
- Right till the end.
- While banging spoons on your head.

774
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,294
- That explains the lumps.
- Bye.

775
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:45,797
Lorelai, darling, thank you for everything.

776
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,134
Patty, your timing is excellent.
There's Claude over there.

777
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,886
Want me to do some matchmaking?

778
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:53,931
He's wearing a golf shirt
and cotton Dockers.

779
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:58,727
- So it was the uniform?
- It's the Biloxi Naval Base all over again.

780
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,312
- Bye.
- See you.

781
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,276
You didn't make it back to the room
last night. Did you get lucky?

782
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,779
- Could you be any cruder?
- Yeah, I could be cruder.

783
00:42:08,821 --> 00:42:11,824
- Mom, did you get...
- Thanks for coming. It was fun.

784
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,243
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's okay.

785
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:16,328
- We'll see you next Friday.
- Bye.

786
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:18,455
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Lorelai.

787
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,876
You just had one grog too many.
Just drink lots of water to rehydrate.

788
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,671
- I will.
- Jackson, thank you for being our squire.

789
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:27,798
You're welcome. By the way...

790
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:30,342
last night when Bootsy was singing
Hotel California...

791
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,678
and banging spoons on his head, did I...

792
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,265
Lift up your shirt and play drums
on your stomach? Yes, you did.

793
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:37,933
- You kept a good beat.
- Yeah.

794
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:40,936
'Cause if the beat was off,
you'd have embarrassed yourself.

795
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,396
Thanks, Rory.

796
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:45,315
- Clara, I'm glad you came.
- I'll see you later.

797
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,526
- Don't kiss.
- Come on.

798
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:48,986
Don't kiss.

799
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:53,532
Come on.

800
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:56,118
- So I guess we're off.
- I guess so.

801
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:07,880
Bye, you guys.

802
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:11,383
Let's go home.

803
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:14,011
- Are we coming to get our bags later?
- Why?

804
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,430
We're walking home.
I don't want to carry them.

805
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,390
Who says we're walking?

806
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:26,023
- This is the only way to ride.
- I wholeheartedly agree.

807
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:31,862
- What happened there?
- I have no idea.

808
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:36,700
Bad news for ringer guy,
but guess who wins by default?

809
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:39,369
I guess that would be us.

810
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:22,287
English
