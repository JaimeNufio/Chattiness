1
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:06,528
Psst! Lorelai!

2
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:07,507
Jackson!

3
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:09,584
Shh! Just come here a sec!

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,230
I need you to get some stuff for me from Doose's.

5
00:00:13,307 --> 00:00:15,657
- Jackson, what are you doing?
- Stop saying my name.

6
00:00:15,796 --> 00:00:19,374
Look, Sookie's got major food cravings, and I can't go into Leech Headquarters

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,120
or they'll be all over me in two seconds flat.

8
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:23,256
Selectman job isn't getting any easier, huh?

9
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:25,139
No, it's getting worse!

10
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:28,104
Like last week, Anne Beninghoff comes to me, right?

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,702
She wants to put a sales cart outside the colonial museum selling revolutionary war books

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,083
and "just a few arrowheads". Fine. Then Sally Lanigan hears about that,

13
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:41,527
and she wants to sell her pine needle sachets out in front of the gazebo. Fine.

14
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,486
But then Kirk comes to me in an outrage because he's allergic to all pine-scented things,

15
00:00:46,557 --> 00:00:50,981
and how could I not know this, and pretty soon I'm nothing but an empty suit of Jackson-skin.

16
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:53,341
- Ew. Well, what do you need?
- Oh, thanks.

17
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:57,698
Uh, let's see here. Grapefruit juice, milk duds,

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,550
bloody mary mix, extra spicy turkey sausage -

19
00:01:00,622 --> 00:01:02,547
this is all going in the same blender, by the way -

20
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:03,392
Good Lordy!

21
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:06,485
Chives, man, I'm getting a stomachache just reading this list!

22
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,234
Give it to me, I'll brave headquarters for ya.

23
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:09,325
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

24
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:15,992
- Do not go where you're going.
- Well, what's one leech versus a swarm?

25
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:17,821
I have no sanctuary!

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,169
The pothole on the road to the Dragonfly is getting worse. Kids are starting to swim in it.

27
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:23,376
I'll put it on the list along with everything else.

28
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:26,258
- Top of the list, please? Jackson?
- Don't!

29
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:28,383
Oh, was that too loud? Can't always tell.

30
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,174
It's on top of the list.

31
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,424
Be back in a flash.

32
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:31,538
- Sookie, I'm home.
- I'm home, too!

33
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,274
Were we followed?

34
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:36,546
I don't think so. Good thing we ditched that Audi in Marseille,

35
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:38,273
now we just have to find that tracking device.

36
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:41,769
Sookie! Honey, what's wrong?

37
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:45,972
I just - it's just - it's just so sad!

38
00:02:46,581 --> 00:02:50,985
Ugh! People magazine! Jackson, you know we don't allow soft human interest stories

39
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,530
- around Sookie when she's pregnant!
- She must have snuck it in!

40
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:56,575
I just felt like they were perfect for each other, you know?

41
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,291
Uh-huh. Who, honey?

42
00:02:58,363 --> 00:03:04,327
The two of them! The one with the hair, and the teeth, and the - you know!

43
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,818
Who's got hair and teeth?

44
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:10,722
And the Divine Brown thing that happened, and bammo! Their loveï¿½s in the toilet!

45
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:12,724
We're talking Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant.

46
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,486
She must have found an old one somewhere.

47
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:16,147
That was years ago, Sookie!

48
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:18,185
Tons of people have broken up since then.

49
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,209
Oh my God!

50
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:22,335
No, no, it's okay. Everyone is together and happy.

51
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:23,593
- Dispose, please.
- Gladly.

52
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:25,504
Oh, is that my food?

53
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:30,989
Yes, yes, look. We got, uh, turkey sausage, extra spicy like you wanted...

54
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:31,822
Yuck.

55
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,274
- And grapefruit juice? Rapini?
- Ugh, puke.

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,851
You're not craving things anymore, are you?

57
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:38,099
- I'm sorry.
- No.

58
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:41,858
I mean, I'm so friggin' impossible. You're so good to me

59
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,601
and you go to all this trouble and you get me everything I want

60
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,204
and then I don't want it anymore.

61
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:50,059
I'm sorry that you have to be in love with a crazy person.

62
00:03:50,173 --> 00:03:52,467
Come here. I'll tell you what.

63
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:57,155
I'll deal with as much moodiness and food weirdness as you can dish out,

64
00:03:57,213 --> 00:04:00,827
as long as you do the actual squeezing a human being out of your body part.

65
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:02,030
Deal.

66
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:06,941
Okay. That car just slowed down as it went past the house.

67
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:09,807
Jackson, why don't you get away from the window, go relax or something?

68
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,113
Oh, I shouldn't be near a window!

69
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:13,751
Why don't you take it easy, sweetie, and go check on Davey?

70
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,372
All right. But if anyone calls for me, I'm not here.

71
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:17,995
And I'm armed and dangerous.

72
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,733
He loves you.

73
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:23,376
Then he's certifiable.

74
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:27,109
'Cause I'm certifiable and you have to be certifiable to put up with that.

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,629
Hey, you're pregnant. You're not supposed to be normal.

76
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,671
I guess so.

77
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:37,200
It may be mean, but when I worry too much about how I'm treating Jackson,

78
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,366
I just remember Brandy.

79
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:40,856
Brandy?

80
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:42,684
Christopher's Brandy.

81
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:43,929
Christopher's Sherry?

82
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,509
Oh. I knew it was something like that.

83
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,986
Anyway, I'm handling this all better than her.

84
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,291
- How is he, anyway?
- Christopher? Fine.

85
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:56,734
Wow, you know what? I have no idea. He never called me again.

86
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,242
- Really?
- Not once since I went over there.

87
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:02,779
I assume he's doing fine, but I don't know.

88
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:06,323
He never called? All those problems with baby were solved in one night?

89
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:08,032
- Kind of weird, isn't it?
- A little.

90
00:05:08,136 --> 00:05:10,742
You never know with him. He's as unpredictable as a pregnant woman.

91
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:11,761
No offense.

92
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:13,277
None taken.

93
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:17,080
I hope he and Gigi are okay, the last time I was over there he was duct taping her diapers.

94
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,587
But, I'm sure he's found the tabby thingies by now.

95
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,666
Yeah, I'm sure he's okay.

96
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,827
- Milk chocolate and artichoke hearts!
- What?

97
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,904
That's what I want and I am not going to change my mind.

98
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:31,146
Milk chocolate - bell peppers! Now I'm not going to change my mind.

99
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:33,960
Jackson, I figured it out! No, dark chocolate.

100
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:38,811
Ooh, taffy! Taffy and walnuts! Taffy, ooh, pistachios! Ooh, hearts of palm!

101
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,683
Paris, please don't compare our reading speeds again. You're fast, I'm slow, enjoy your trophy.

102
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,522
I need the exact time of today's sunset.

103
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:50,852
I'm in the middle of an article.

104
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,454
Well, if you read faster you wouldn't be.

105
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,063
Okay, the time of today's sunset is four thirty-one.

106
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,102
Okay. Then I just have to keep my mind occupied until four thirty-one.

107
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:03,534
- Paris.
- What?

108
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:06,021
Tell me again why you're fasting for Ramadan.

109
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,780
Look, Rory, if you want to crib your articles from the A.P. wire that's your business.

110
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:12,885
I, on the other hand, actually give a rat's ass about journalistic integrity.

111
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:15,300
When I write about Ramadan, I experience Ramadan.

112
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:18,695
- Are you chewing gum?
- What? Yes, why?

113
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:20,661
I'd really prefer it if you didn't chew it at me.

114
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,876
Paris, did you know that not eating can make people kind of snippy?

115
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:26,243
Ramadan is about a lot more than just not eating.

116
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:30,257
It calls for a total abstinence from food particles passing through the mouth or nose.

117
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,800
Your Bazooka is passing through my nose.

118
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:33,236
It's unlocked.

119
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:34,972
Hey Marty.

120
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:39,053
So, I just bartended this crazy brunch, with chocolate fountains

121
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:41,967
and floating ice sculptures and I snagged us all kinds of hors d'oeuvres.

122
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,199
Nice going, bucko.

123
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:46,230
Okay, so she didn't really mean nice going, right?

124
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:48,432
'Cause there's sort of a devil eye thing going on.

125
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:49,554
She's fasting.

126
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,319
People came to America to escape religious persecution.

127
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,439
Well, what religion is anti-leftovers?

128
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:58,521
- Hello?
- Hi, guess where I am.

129
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,861
- Mom!
- Go on, guess.

130
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:03,828
- Oh, I don't know, Luke's?
- But not just at Luke's, on the phone at Luke's.

131
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:06,833
And it's all perfectly legal, because I'm on the diner's phone.

132
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:09,420
- A loophole, nice.
- Gotta love a loophole.

133
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:12,487
Getting to use Luke's behind the counter phone, that's like getting to wear his letterman jacket.

134
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:14,872
I know. Maybe now he'll ask me to the sock-hop.

135
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,612
I'm glad you guys are all loophole-y and sock-hop-y. It's nice.

136
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,601
Yeah. Well, um, I just called to, you know...

137
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:24,692
brag about my loophole and check on plans for Friday night dinner?

138
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:25,507
Hey!

139
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:27,468
Hun, hold on a sec.

140
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:28,886
What are you doing back here?

141
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,021
You didn't have permission to be behind the counter, did you?

142
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,778
You don't need permission if you're the girlfriend!

143
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,310
A sack of potatoes falls on your head, the insurance company doesn't care if you're the girlfriend.

144
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,252
Well, you're storing potatoes in a very weird place if you're worried about them falling on people's heads.

145
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,333
Go, go, get!

146
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:42,717
Okay, I'm getting.

147
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:44,108
He's kicking you out!

148
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:47,742
No. He's just my boyfriend, so protective of my safety,

149
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:50,000
the thought of food falling on my head makes him crazy.

150
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:54,327
So, anyway, what's better for you, carpool or meet there?

151
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:55,485
Meet's better I guess.

152
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:56,734
Okay, honey I'll see you there.

153
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:58,859
Oh, wait, there's something I want to run by you.

154
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:00,921
Can't you just plug your nose or something?

155
00:08:01,003 --> 00:08:04,562
Sure, ask a billion Muslims to plug their noses. That makes a lot of sense, Marty.

156
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:10,613
- Okay, so I've got an idea.
- Finally, this Yale thing's kicking in.

157
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,991
I am sick of humoring Grandma and Grandpa during this stupid separation of theirs.

158
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:17,496
This "drinks here, dinner there" is dumb.

159
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:19,666
It's not working, and we should not do it anymore.

160
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:24,054
Well, if you feel it is best to end the Friday night dinners,

161
00:08:24,115 --> 00:08:26,942
then, as your mother, I feel it is my duty to support you.

162
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:29,717
I'm not saying we should end Friday night dinners.

163
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:33,061
Okay, well, then, as your mother, I feel it is my duty to tell you that you're wrong.

164
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:35,518
We need to take a stand. No more humoring.

165
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,554
We need to get them in a room and talk some sense into them.

166
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:41,201
And to do that I think we should divide and conquer.

167
00:08:41,264 --> 00:08:44,078
So this Friday I'll have dinner with one and you'll have dinner with the other.

168
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:47,627
Uh-huh. Hey, what happened to the idea of ending Friday night dinners?

169
00:08:47,678 --> 00:08:49,319
'Cause I thought that one had real potential.

170
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:52,747
This way we can each talk to them, one on one. Break them down.

171
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,645
Convince them that their separation isn't okay with us.

172
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:56,633
It's not?

173
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,055
Mom, I know they both want to be with each other.

174
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,195
Hun, my parents are very stubborn.

175
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:03,305
I don't want you to get your hopes up about the outcome.

176
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:06,213
But I can't stand it the way it is. I think they both miss each other

177
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,121
but they're just too proud, and it's just - it's kind of breaking my heart.

178
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,495
So, which one do you want me to take?

179
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:14,497
How about I'll take Grandpa and you'll take Grandma.

180
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:15,869
Bah! No.

181
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:17,656
Okay, then I'll take Grandma, you take Grandpa.

182
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:19,520
- Bah! No.
- Mom!

183
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:24,564
Can't I take the butler? He doesn't talk much and, as far as I can tell, thoroughly enjoys the way I dress.

184
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:28,060
She's throwing things at me! Religious sanctuary, please.

185
00:09:28,972 --> 00:09:30,824
The butler is not an option.

186
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,417
Fine, I'll take her.

187
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,331
Thank you. Bye.

188
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:37,513
What's the bacon wrapped around?

189
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:40,199
Something bacon should never be wrapped around.

190
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:41,260
Rich people.

191
00:09:41,394 --> 00:09:42,750
They live very different lives.

192
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:43,969
Thanks.

193
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,300
- So, that was Rory?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:46,402
- How's she doing?
- Fine.

195
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:48,499
With the Dean thing and all? The breakup?

196
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:51,341
She sounds okay actually. She's petite but she's strong.

197
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:52,309
Good. I'm glad.

198
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,567
- Don't gloat.
- I'm not gloating.

199
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,299
Yes, you are.

200
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:57,609
I just said I'm glad she's okay. That's not gloating.

201
00:09:57,685 --> 00:10:01,202
It was your tone. Like you were covering up for being gloaty by being extra non-gloaty.

202
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,769
- Lorelai.
- You always hated him, I get it.

203
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,638
I never hated him, I just never thought he was right for Rory.

204
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,731
I swear, I'm not gloating.

205
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:10,603
Well, I don't know. If it walks like a gloat and quacks like a gloat...

206
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,272
- I wasn't.
- I gotta go. Kiss.

207
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,391
I stink, there's your headline, keep your distance.

208
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:20,090
- Better run.
- Call you later.

209
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:22,292
If I don't strangle myself with the phone cord I'll answer.

210
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:23,362
Hi, TJ.

211
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:26,623
Three feet, Lorelai, 'cause I haven't showered in as many days.

212
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:28,303
Oh. Bye, TJ.

213
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:32,675
- I need your shower, buddy.
- I'm sorry. Broken.

214
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:34,841
Really? 'Cause you're looking powder fresh.

215
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:36,138
I am not powder fresh.

216
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:40,903
Come on! Luke, we got no water at our new place, and the flies, they are a-buzzing, man.

217
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,342
Fine, you can use my shower, TJ.

218
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:45,075
You're the best, you know that? I worship you.

219
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:46,985
Yeah. You should build an altar.

220
00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:52,029
You know, I know I shouldn't ask you this, but why isn't your water turned on?

221
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:56,069
'Cause the pipes got trashed after I demo'd the upstairs bathroom.

222
00:10:56,218 --> 00:10:57,713
You weren't going to demo the bathroom.

223
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,810
Right, but I had a little accident installing a towel rack,

224
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,884
and next thing you know, the whole bathroom's demo'd.

225
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:03,954
Because of the towel rack.

226
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,064
I got very angry at this towel rack.

227
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:07,440
Yes, that's... that's very normal.

228
00:11:07,522 --> 00:11:11,035
But I got some replacement pipe, I just gotta cut it up into shorter pieces

229
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,549
and stick it together, and we're good to go.

230
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:14,982
Okay, sounds like you know what you're doing.

231
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:18,603
I just need some kind of tool that cuts pipe, what would you call that?

232
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:20,144
I don't know, a pipe cutter?

233
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:22,232
That's it! A pipe cutter!

234
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:24,347
You know anyone who's got a pipe cutter?

235
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:26,451
I have a pipe cutter, would you like to borrow it?

236
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:27,757
That cuts pipe, right?

237
00:11:27,828 --> 00:11:30,143
Hey, TJ, why don't you just hire a professional?

238
00:11:30,198 --> 00:11:33,890
Because I'm trying to be responsible. What with the move and being in escrow and everything,

239
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:39,360
I'm not exactly flush. So I figured I'd do it myself. Is that so wrong?

240
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:41,652
I'll help you cut the pipe, TJ.

241
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,202
Oh, hey, that's beyond the call.

242
00:11:44,294 --> 00:11:47,705
You've got to be the best brother-in-law in the world.

243
00:11:47,782 --> 00:11:49,891
Uh-huh, thanks. Anything else?

244
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,747
You know it's real hell trying to make coffee without water.

245
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:54,428
Have some coffee, TJ.

246
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,828
And a cruller, to cut the bitterness.

247
00:11:56,915 --> 00:12:01,795
'Cause sometimes, no offense, I find your coffee a little bitter.

248
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:04,518
I mean it's good. It's just a little bitter.

249
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,037
We need to talk.

250
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:08,830
Shoot.

251
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,497
There's a couple here I thought I recognized but I was not sure.

252
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:14,748
So I consulted an old guest ledger from the Independence Inn

253
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:17,861
and found a physical description that confirmed their identities.

254
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:18,998
Physical description?

255
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,413
Yes. I had described them with astonishing accuracy,

256
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:25,030
down to the crooked eyes and unsightly moles.

257
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:28,035
You have a system of describing what people's moles look like?

258
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:32,699
Mm-hmm. Moles, freckles, estimate of weight, are they buxom, is their chin cleft,

259
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,932
do they walk with any sort of limp, et cetera, et cetera.

260
00:12:35,003 --> 00:12:38,526
But this is beside the point. You remember the Bathrobe Bandits.

261
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:39,463
No.

262
00:12:39,621 --> 00:12:42,197
The married couple, from Massachusetts that stole bathrobes

263
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:44,174
from the Independence Inn every time they came.

264
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:47,379
We called them the Bathrobe Bandits. They are here.

265
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:48,480
Did they bring their moles?

266
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:51,141
With your permission I'm going to remove their bathrobes from their room

267
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,354
- as a preventive measure.
- No, no, no. Michel, come on.

268
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,438
If they steal robes, we can just charge their credit card.

269
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:59,012
And if they take a credenza! Or a couch! You think they'll stop at robes?

270
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,853
Then I'll start jotting down mole locations along with you.

271
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:03,859
But for now, let's take a flyer on them.

272
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:06,517
- I should never tell you anything.
- Promise?

273
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,113
I'm going to leave a vaguely threatening note in their room.

274
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,209
No, no, no, Michel!

275
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:25,820
Hello?

276
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:28,089
Well, if it isn't Mr. Incommunicado.

277
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:29,029
Lorelai.

278
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:32,102
I figured you turned Amish or something and couldn't make any calls

279
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:34,872
until Rumspringa, but no, here you are, answering a phone.

280
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:35,875
Uh, yeah.

281
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,406
So, how are you?

282
00:13:37,806 --> 00:13:38,928
Uh, fine.

283
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,156
Is this a bad time?

284
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:43,084
No, not at all. So what's going on?

285
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,624
Not much, just working at the old salt mine.

286
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:50,222
But earlier I was talking to Sookie who, by the way, got herself knocked up again, crazy slut.

287
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:54,502
So uh, anyway, we were talking about babies and she asked me about you and Gigi

288
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:57,743
and that's when I realized I hadn't talked to you in a while, so here we are.

289
00:13:57,857 --> 00:14:00,882
Sorry I haven't called, I've just been, you know, really busy.

290
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:05,920
Okay. Well, no worries, I know you've got your plate full taking care of Gigi.

291
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,967
Um, are you sure this isn't a bad time?

292
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,130
No, no it's fine. Fine.

293
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:16,688
Perfect. So, how is Gigi? She still alive? Last time I was there things were a little dicey.

294
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,956
She's good. Everything's fine, Lor, everything's good. Your help was great and I'm absolutely fine.

295
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:25,842
Okay, well, good. So I guess I'll talk to you later.

296
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:30,190
Sure. Definitely, okay? I'll talk to you later. Take care.

297
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:31,243
Okay. Bye.

298
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:34,797
Listen, Lor, I just want you to know that I only called you before because I was desperate.

299
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,124
I mean, there was no other reason. I was just panicked and I didn't think, you know?

300
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,071
Chris, sure.

301
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:43,507
I know that I shouldn't have bothered you. I know you have your own life and your own stuff,

302
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:45,918
and I shouldn't be butting in. But it was just a one-time thing, you know?

303
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:47,295
So you don't have to worry about it.

304
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:50,710
Chris! Come on, you can call me any time you want. You know that.

305
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:52,117
Yeah, well.

306
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,935
I'm always here for Gigi, whatever you need.

307
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:57,597
'Cause we got bonds, baby, just try and break 'em.

308
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,010
Thanks, Lor.

309
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:00,038
No problem.

310
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:02,117
Anyhow, Gigi's great.

311
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,607
I've got new pictures too, I can e-mail them to you if you want.

312
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,443
Or bring her around next time you're in the 'hood.

313
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:07,904
Stars Hollow is a 'hood now?

314
00:15:07,996 --> 00:15:10,577
Oh, it's always been a 'hood, we just try to keep it on the down-low.

315
00:15:10,653 --> 00:15:11,974
But seriously, you should come by.

316
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,181
Well, I'm actually going to be adjacent to the 'hood on Saturday,

317
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:16,152
'cause I'm taking Gigi to see her grandparents.

318
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:17,402
Come by Saturday.

319
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,019
Are you sure? I don't want to...

320
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:21,478
Come by. We can have lunch here at the Inn. You, me and Gigi.

321
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,616
That way I can check she's still got all her arms and legs.

322
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,935
All right. Sure. Sounds good.

323
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:30,042
- Uh, Saturday it is.
- Okay, see you then.

324
00:15:30,237 --> 00:15:32,173
- Yes, you will.
- Bye.

325
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:37,789
Grandpa, it's fine.

326
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:39,699
No, it certainly is not fine.

327
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:44,246
When you're entertaining an elegant young lady for dinner, then dinner is to be expected.

328
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:48,874
But I just sprang this on you. You can't be held accountable for your lack of elegant-young-lady food.

329
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:53,386
Well, I am delighted with your company, though I'm still a little confused at the new arrangement.

330
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:56,315
Well, Mom and I realized that we don't really get to spend as much time

331
00:15:56,375 --> 00:16:00,477
with you and Grandma since the separation. So we decided to split up.

332
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,748
Well, how would you feel about

333
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:08,157
some batteries and Nutella?

334
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,974
Oh, rats, I had that for lunch.

335
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:12,468
Well, that seems to be all I have in here.

336
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,469
Robert's shopping skills leave something to be desired.

337
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:20,583
- So, Grandpa...
- Wait! I think I have some canned peaches.

338
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:23,565
- You've really made it comfortable out here.
- Huh, pears.

339
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,908
Nice. Like a vacation spot. You know, fun, and all yours,

340
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:31,356
not permanent, but fun - for now.

341
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:35,049
Yes, well, "fun for now" is exactly what I was going for.

342
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,845
- So it's not permanent.
- What?

343
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:39,856
The pool house. It's not permanent. You just said "fun for now".

344
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:42,461
Did I? I must have heard it somewhere.

345
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,692
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's good to shake things up every now and then.

346
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,977
You know, put a little paint on the house, move the furniture around the den, go blonde.

347
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:54,975
But after you've done all that, it can also be nice to go back to something that's comfortable.

348
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:58,959
Something you've depended on for, let's say, forty years.

349
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:02,158
I mean, if something's been around that long, it must have been for a reason, right?

350
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:04,482
You're a lovely girl.

351
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:05,763
I have good genes.

352
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,676
Oh, I think I remember seeing a frozen pizza in here.

353
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:09,469
Really?

354
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:11,322
Aha! Now...

355
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:17,114
the downside of this discovery is since Robert is currently doing all the shopping,

356
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:20,877
this pizza could have been here since Lorelai's tenth birthday party.

357
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,788
The upside, however, is that there is cheese in the crust.

358
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:26,300
I've always been a "glass-is-half-full" kind of gal myself.

359
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:27,493
All righty then.

360
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,483
Here goes nothing.

361
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,675
Stupid little...

362
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:36,929
What, Mom?

363
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:40,021
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to make a proper drink, that's all.

364
00:17:40,374 --> 00:17:42,049
Sorry about the change of plans.

365
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,522
Oh, please. I'm as flexible as the next person.

366
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,051
See, Rory thought that since Dad's moved out to the pool house,

367
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:48,996
we're not getting enough time with either of you. So...

368
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:51,640
I guess I could use the ice in the freezer, though it's probably old.

369
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,567
You know what they say, a little notice ensures fresh ice.

370
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:57,536
- I'm sorry, who says that?
- We'll just have to have scotch neat.

371
00:17:57,604 --> 00:17:58,233
Super.

372
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:02,222
I'd offer you wine, but all the wine I have has to breathe.

373
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,609
That requires notice.

374
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:11,289
What are you looking at?

375
00:18:11,453 --> 00:18:14,930
Nothing. It's just, isn't this weird to you?

376
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:16,870
- What?
- Sitting next to each other?

377
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:20,116
- Would you like me to move?
- No, it's fine. It's just - close.

378
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,675
Will you explain to me again why we are doing this?

379
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:25,221
I have no idea, 'cause you usually sit over there.

380
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:27,991
I'm talking about Rory being in the pool house, Lorelai.

381
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:32,543
Rory just thought we should split up tonight, get in some quality couch time.

382
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:37,581
It seems very silly. We had a perfectly good system worked out. I don't know why we changed it.

383
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,352
So Mom. Do you think you and Dad are getting back together?

384
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:45,368
- Absolutely not.
- Okay. Got any peanuts?

385
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:48,378
Your father has proven to me once and for all he's moved on with his life.

386
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,225
You don't think that moving on with his life would've actually included moving?

387
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:52,859
- No.
- Okay.

388
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,838
We attended the Dorman School Bazaar last week - it was a big, formal gala,

389
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,472
all our friends were there - and at dinner he made me reach for the butter.

390
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:02,260
What?

391
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:06,018
It was sitting right there in front of him, and yet he didn't offer me the dish.

392
00:19:06,116 --> 00:19:10,585
He buttered his own roll, offered the dish to the man next to him, and that was it.

393
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:12,867
And that's why you think he's moved on?

394
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,008
It was a total disregard for my needs.

395
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,354
I might as well not have had a roll in front of me at all.

396
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:20,496
Well, Mom, I'm sorry.

397
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:21,808
Very upsetting.

398
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:25,995
But at some point you have to face facts, and the facts are, he's moved on.

399
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,064
And therefore I should move on also.

400
00:19:28,156 --> 00:19:30,465
Absolutely. Move on dot org.

401
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,882
I think it's time for me to date.

402
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:35,801
Oh, my God.

403
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:39,349
- I want to go on a date.
- With... a man?

404
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,021
- No, a weasel. Of course with a man!
- I'm not hearing this.

405
00:19:42,113 --> 00:19:44,352
Well, why shouldn't I date? I'm still a viable commodity.

406
00:19:44,423 --> 00:19:46,287
I need a paper towel and a Valium, please.

407
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:49,845
There are plenty of men at the club who, in the past, have made their interest in me known,

408
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:52,636
I just need to figure out how to reciprocate their feelings.

409
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,414
You have a lot of experience with men. How do you let them know that you're available?

410
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:58,818
Well, one of those bench ads usually does the trick.

411
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:00,907
Lorelai, stop it. I need help here.

412
00:20:00,987 --> 00:20:04,897
It's been years since I did this, and I don't remember the proper procedure!

413
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,085
Now take me through this step-by-step.

414
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:11,243
You see a man, you walk up to him and you say...

415
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,740
- Hello.
- Is that too forward?

416
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,319
No, it's the appropriate way to indicate you're open to a social engagement.

417
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,606
Unless, however, you are approaching a weasel.

418
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:24,022
Then I believe the proper signal is just to offer him your hindquarters.

419
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:28,117
Hey. My night was great.

420
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:33,023
Grandpa made frozen pizza. Granted, he made it on a cedar plank,

421
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,918
which was not what the manufacturer intended, but I got a chance to say a lot of things to him.

422
00:20:37,994 --> 00:20:40,668
Things about living in the pool house, and about him and Grandma,

423
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:44,124
and though I used veiled references I know he got my point

424
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,924
and he is definitely thinking about it. How'd you do?

425
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:48,542
- Grandma wants to date.
- What?

426
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:51,819
She wants to date men who hang out at the club and who have expressed interest in her in the past.

427
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:55,301
What do you mean she wants to date? You weren't supposed to make her want to date!

428
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:57,941
You were supposed to make her want to get back together with Grandpa!

429
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,129
Hey, I told you not to make me have dinner alone with her.

430
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,356
What did you say to her?

431
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,895
I said "Are you getting back together with Dad?" and she said he wouldn't butter her roll.

432
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,964
- I can't believe you.
- I'm sorry. I tried.

433
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,795
- You did not try.
- I did try, I just sucked at it.

434
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:13,601
Look, she probably didn't mean it, okay? She's just mad at Dad, and she was just talking.

435
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:16,077
Next week we'll switch. You can have dinner with my mother,

436
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:17,982
and I'll marry my dad off to a nice baroness.

437
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:19,227
- Don't joke.
- Don't hate me.

438
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:21,249
I don't hate you, I can't hate the pathetic.

439
00:21:21,296 --> 00:21:23,661
Good. Now, I have a complaint to register.

440
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,718
Because of your flawed plan I was deprived of Friday night with my kid.

441
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,147
I was trying to reunite your parents.

442
00:21:28,258 --> 00:21:29,702
Oh, sure, now they're my parents.

443
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:32,878
So anyway, I was thinking if you're not busy tomorrow,

444
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:34,766
how about you come meet me for lunch at the Dragonfly.

445
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:35,749
- What time?
- One-ish?

446
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:36,927
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

447
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:39,779
- And stay away from Grandma.
- Oh, gee, there's a demand.

448
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,275
Well, I like that it's got rooms, very novel for an inn.

449
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:46,840
Mm, the guests love it when they don't have to sleep communally. They pay extra for it.

450
00:21:46,911 --> 00:21:49,666
Good squeaky stairs, helps sell the old inn aspect.

451
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:52,021
- Actually we had those squeaks installed.
- Squeak Masters?

452
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:53,736
- Oh, you've used them?
- Several times.

453
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:56,062
Reception's over there, living room's through here.

454
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:58,436
Hey, you recognize the bobble head dolls on the mantle?

455
00:21:58,487 --> 00:21:59,753
You put those out in public?

456
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:01,877
Hey, they are a cherished part of my childhood.

457
00:22:01,944 --> 00:22:04,935
Plus all the dirty pieces broke off ten years ago, so now they're just charming.

458
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,941
- I like the jukebox.
- I thought you would!

459
00:22:07,263 --> 00:22:08,677
And here's where we feed them.

460
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,908
You feed them too?

461
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:12,829
Yes, and once a day we let them use the bathroom and sit on the furniture.

462
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:13,977
Classy joint.

463
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:19,378
So I'm thinking you should order the steak sandwich on garlic bread. Thanks.

464
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:22,394
Or fried chicken. Seriously good fried chicken.

465
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:24,733
Or - yeah. Get the pork chops.

466
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:29,403
'Cause normally eating pork chops is very similar to sucking on the Pottery Barn catalogue,

467
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:33,396
but Sookie does this brining thing in a saltwater bourbon solution,

468
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:36,371
sounds a little like laundry but it's actually unbelievably good.

469
00:22:37,846 --> 00:22:38,567
What?

470
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:42,219
Nothing, it's just... You did it.

471
00:22:43,354 --> 00:22:44,286
I...

472
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:45,967
You did it.

473
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:48,656
Yeah. I think I did.

474
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,619
How sappy is it going to sound if I say I'm proud of you?

475
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,278
Oh my God, so sappy.

476
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:54,701
Yeah, well, I am.

477
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,966
Thanks, Chris.

478
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:57,547
Yeah.

479
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:01,628
Okay, so I think you were trying to talk me into the pork chop.

480
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,854
Yes I was.

481
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,395
Mom. Hey, I'm...

482
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:09,088
Hey, surprise. Look what the mommy dragged in.

483
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,234
Hey, Rory.

484
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,428
Hey Dad.

485
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,967
You haven't said hi to your sister yet.

486
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:16,112
Oh. Right.

487
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:20,210
Hey Gigi. Remember me? I'm Rory.

488
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,901
- I show her your picture all the time.
- Great. Thanks.

489
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:24,996
Well your timing's perfect. I'm starved, have a sit.

490
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:28,784
- Isn't this a nice surprise?
- Oh, very nice, yes.

491
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:30,444
I like to see Gigi.

492
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:33,812
How you doing there, uh, Gigi?

493
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:35,887
That thumb tasting pretty good there? 'Cause seriously,

494
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:39,987
you soak it in a saltwater bourbon solution overnight, you'll see a major improvement.

495
00:23:40,151 --> 00:23:44,114
Lorelai? Excuse me. There's an incident in the front you might want to check in on.

496
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:46,025
Okay, Rob. I'll be right back.

497
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:49,388
Don't say anything hilarious while I'm gone. Hmm.

498
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:57,539
- Rory.
- One thing.

499
00:23:57,642 --> 00:23:59,992
I've only asked you for one thing. Ever.

500
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:01,922
- This wasn't my idea.
- Stop.

501
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:05,455
Rory, I didn't call. After you asked me not to, I didn't.

502
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:06,669
Your mother called me.

503
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:09,582
She called me because she hadn't heard from me in a while.

504
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,866
And the reason that she hadn't heard from me in a while

505
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:15,301
is because you asked me to stay away and I did. Please stop shaking your head.

506
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:17,441
- I don't believe you.
- She called me, Rory.

507
00:24:17,545 --> 00:24:20,449
- She called me, she asked me to lunch.
- You didn't have to accept.

508
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:23,636
I had absolutely no good reason to say no. What was I supposed to do?

509
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:25,402
Tell her that you don't want me to see her anymore?

510
00:24:25,535 --> 00:24:27,446
I don't want to rat you out. I'm sorry.

511
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:31,532
Look, I didn't even know you were going to be here. This is as much a surprise to me as it is to you.

512
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:35,101
Oh, I see. So you didn't think I was going to be here so therefore that makes it safe

513
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:36,943
to come 'cause maybe I wouldn't find out about it!

514
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,605
No, Rory, no. All right? That is not how it went down.

515
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:42,663
You know what? I don't have to explain myself to you. I've done absolutely nothing wrong here.

516
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,325
- Fine.
- Look, I'm sorry you're upset,

517
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,694
but you know what? Your mother and I have had a relationship long before you ever existed.

518
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,809
We grew up together. We had a child together,

519
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:53,056
and no matter what is going on, that does not change.

520
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:57,204
Great. You knew her first, so that gives you the right to just waltz in and screw everything up?

521
00:24:57,285 --> 00:25:01,095
I did not waltz in, I did not call her. You cannot make me the bad guy here.

522
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:03,951
- Hey, if the black hat fits.
- I'm your father, kid, okay?

523
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:06,347
- I think that demands a tiny bit of respect here.
- Fine.

524
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,274
See, this is why I love this job. See, Michel has been obsessed with these guests

525
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:14,515
who he swears are the notorious "Bathrobe Bandits" from the Independence Inn -

526
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:17,494
at least the moles matched. So apparently they were checking out

527
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,341
and Michel stopped them and demanded that they open their suitcase and they refused.

528
00:25:21,411 --> 00:25:26,229
So he grabs the guy's suitcase and starts tearing through all of his stuff,

529
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,896
which of course went over really well, and when I got there the wife was calling the cops

530
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:32,916
and the husband was chasing Michel around with a golf club.

531
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,172
It took a comped bill and two free bathrobes in addition to the ones they had stolen

532
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:41,389
to get them to drop the charges. Plus, Michel ripped his pants and his underwear is pink and shiny.

533
00:25:45,523 --> 00:25:48,491
Did I not hit the "pink nd shiny" hard enough?

534
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:50,847
Should it have been "his drawers were pink and shiny"?

535
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm confused, 'cause I was going to hit the Orpheum circuit with that material - wow.

536
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,476
- Did I miss something here?
- No, uh, nothing.

537
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,298
Look Lor, I should be going.

538
00:26:01,614 --> 00:26:04,753
What? No. We didn't get our briny pork chops yet.

539
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:08,824
I know, I just - I really need to get to my parent's house, and Gigi's going to need her nap soon. So...

540
00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:10,258
She can nap here.

541
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:14,255
No, it's okay. Um, place looks great.

542
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:18,255
Really, and, uh, tell Sookie I said thanks, uh, from me.

543
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:19,565
Bye, Rory.

544
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:20,394
Bye.

545
00:26:20,486 --> 00:26:22,213
- Chris...
- I'll call you later.

546
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:27,327
Okay, start connecting those dots.

547
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:29,851
- Did you call him and invite him to lunch?
- What?

548
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:32,570
- Did you call him and invite him to lunch?
- Yeah, I did.

549
00:26:32,646 --> 00:26:34,209
- He didn't call you?
- No.

550
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,633
He didn't initiate this?

551
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,997
No. Rory, what is going on?

552
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,897
Huh? Answer me.

553
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:42,923
- I went to see Dad.
- When, today?

554
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:45,903
No, a while ago. Right after Sherry left.

555
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:49,211
I went to see him and I told him that I didn't want him to call you anymore.

556
00:26:49,292 --> 00:26:52,353
- Why?
- Mom. Come on.

557
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,483
No "Mom, come on". Why, why did you do that?

558
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:58,354
I didn't want him to screw anything up between you and Luke.

559
00:26:58,437 --> 00:27:02,508
Oh, kid. You are so far off here. That is not going to happen.

560
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,889
Every time he comes back he ends up messing up your life.

561
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,880
- Not true!
- It's completely true.

562
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:10,162
He wants you back and then he disappears or Sherry gets pregnant

563
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:13,393
or he loses his job or he just takes off, whatever.

564
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,117
No good reason necessary. And it's been like this forever

565
00:27:16,204 --> 00:27:17,904
and you just let him do it, you can't help it.

566
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:18,979
Rory, come on!

567
00:27:19,077 --> 00:27:20,643
You can't just break free of him.

568
00:27:20,735 --> 00:27:22,062
What are you talking about?

569
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:23,986
You're engaged to Max and then suddenly you're not.

570
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,070
Christopher had nothing to do with Max.

571
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,575
Who was the person you were calling from your bachelorette party?

572
00:27:28,672 --> 00:27:31,866
I was drunk. I tried to call Abe Vigoda too, if you remember.

573
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,201
You're just always waiting for him to get himself together.

574
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,715
No, no, hon. I am not always waiting for him.

575
00:27:36,793 --> 00:27:39,500
There have been times when, yes, it would have been nice

576
00:27:39,552 --> 00:27:44,947
to actually be with the father of my kid, but not now. I'm with Luke, completely.

577
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:46,448
What did he say when you told him?

578
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,020
- Told who what?
- Luke.

579
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,591
What did he say when you told him you were having lunch with Dad?

580
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,160
Nothing.

581
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,761
- He didn't care?
- No. He didn't care.

582
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,015
He didn't have to care, 'cause there's nothing to care about.

583
00:27:58,101 --> 00:27:59,034
If you say so.

584
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:03,053
I appreciate you being concerned for me, but don't be. I'm good.

585
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:05,075
Okay.

586
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,238
Let's order, shall we?

587
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:15,489
She was so serious.

588
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:19,202
You know how she gets really serious, like when she saw "The Way We Were"

589
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:23,037
and she couldn't believe that Hubbell was going to leave Katie after she had the baby?

590
00:28:23,164 --> 00:28:25,761
Oh, I remember. She talked about it for weeks.

591
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:28,719
"How could he do that? She was the only one who cared about the blacklisting.

592
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:30,763
She was the only one who thought he could write a novel. "

593
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:33,367
On and on and on. That's the face she had on today.

594
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:34,842
She was just worried about you.

595
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:38,715
And when she threw that "What did Luke say" thing at me...

596
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,158
She's got a good left hook.

597
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:43,476
I lied to my kid, Sookie. I hate that I lied to her.

598
00:28:43,552 --> 00:28:47,622
But I didn't want her to think there was any weird reason why I didn't tell Luke.

599
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,444
Was there any weird reason that you didn't tell Luke?

600
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:51,587
Sookie, come on.

601
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:54,063
I don't know. Maybe you were afraid that he would get jealous.

602
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:56,424
I'd be afraid that Jackson would get jealous.

603
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:58,181
I was not afraid that he'd get jealous.

604
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,290
- He did beat up a car.
- One time.

605
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,452
That we know of.

606
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:04,376
No, I didn't tell him because it was no big deal!

607
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,135
I thought it was no big deal.

608
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:09,101
I should have told him, right?

609
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:10,008
Well...

610
00:29:10,104 --> 00:29:11,467
Yeah. I should have told him.

611
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:14,764
Now he's going to think I'm hiding something from him and I'm not.

612
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,576
Damn it. He's going to beat up my car.

613
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,641
It's American, it can take it.

614
00:29:19,265 --> 00:29:21,850
I cam home from work and I found these on the doorstep.

615
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:23,203
What the hell is this supposed to mean?

616
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:24,641
Hon, maybe it's just a joke.

617
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:28,015
No. This is not a joke. This is a threat.

618
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:31,061
Yeah. Those people at Butterick Patterns play pretty rough.

619
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:34,272
This is the fish on the doorstep. It's the horse head in the bed.

620
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,163
It's the "Either your signature or your brains are going to be on the contract".

621
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:39,700
Jackson! Calm down!

622
00:29:39,816 --> 00:29:44,363
I will not calm down! I told them I would not do any ribbon cutting ceremonies!

623
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:45,151
Who's them?

624
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:48,694
Them! The town! The lunatics who voted for me!

625
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:52,080
Okay, could you put the giant scissors down and then do the waving around?

626
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,337
We have to move. Pack up, we're getting out.

627
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:57,516
Okay. Or, you could just ask them at the next town meeting

628
00:29:57,614 --> 00:30:00,138
not to leave giant scissors on our porch anymore!

629
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:02,206
Town meeting? Oh, no.

630
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:05,692
No way. There will be no town meeting.

631
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:06,375
What?

632
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:07,884
There's going to be lots of upset people.

633
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:09,897
The town meeting is a two-hundred-year-old tradition.

634
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:11,089
Tradition over!

635
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,735
Only hell waits for me at town meetings. Spread the word.

636
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:18,617
That's sweet. He's having sympathy mood swings.

637
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,203
He loves me.

638
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:24,536
- How you doing? You need coffee?
- No.

639
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,995
- No?
- Sure.

640
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:27,781
- Sure?
- Yes. Coffee good.

641
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:30,274
Your cup's full.

642
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:32,353
Oh, well, then no. No, coffee bad.

643
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:37,683
- Hey, did I tell you about the Bathrobe Bandits?
- Nope.

644
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,864
Oh, well, very funny story.

645
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:43,091
Back at the Independence Inn there was this couple and they would come in all the time

646
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,829
and steal the bathrobes - they would make Michel crazy. So, today...

647
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:47,429
- Up.
- Right.

648
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:49,262
- So today, they showed up...
- Who?

649
00:30:49,306 --> 00:30:52,670
The Bathrobe Bandits. They showed up and they stayed and then they were checking out

650
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:56,418
and then, get this, the bellboy comes running over and tells me

651
00:30:56,484 --> 00:31:00,109
to "Come quick, there's a situation in the lobby". And so I come running to the lobby...

652
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,388
You can put your plate down.

653
00:31:01,466 --> 00:31:01,952
Right.

654
00:31:02,045 --> 00:31:05,588
So I run to the lobby and Michel is being chased and the wife is calling the cops

655
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:09,642
and I comped their room and gave them free bathrobes to stop the yelling and the calling

656
00:31:09,724 --> 00:31:12,117
- and this is a very bad story.
- It wasn't that bad.

657
00:31:12,197 --> 00:31:14,881
This is the second time I've told it. Both times, crickets.

658
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:21,423
I mean, Rory and Christopher looked at me like I was Pauly Shore.

659
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:23,114
- Christopher?
- Rory's Dad.

660
00:31:23,222 --> 00:31:25,664
He came for lunch today. I had lunch with him today.

661
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,145
And Rory. Had lunch with Rory and Christopher.

662
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,659
And Gigi, his daughter with Sherry, he brought her 'cause Sherry moved to France

663
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:35,428
and he's a full time dad now and we all had lunch. All of us, together, today.

664
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:39,840
And when I told the Bathrobe Bandit story they all acted like that.

665
00:31:40,589 --> 00:31:43,947
Except Gigi, who spit up, 'cause she's a baby. That's what they do.

666
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:45,515
Okay.

667
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:49,759
Okay.

668
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:56,793
- Hello?
- You get over here right now!

669
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,638
- Who is this?
- This is you in twenty years! Who is this, I swear!

670
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:03,291
- Mom, calm down.
- He'll be here in one hour

671
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:06,393
and I have no idea what to wear. You've got to come right now.

672
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:08,242
Who'll be there in one hour, Dad?

673
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,679
- Simon McLane!
- Who is Simon McLane?

674
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,598
- He's my date!
- What?!

675
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:16,189
I have no idea what to put on. I'm in a blind panic and it's all your fault.

676
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:17,617
How is it my fault?

677
00:32:17,693 --> 00:32:19,454
Because I used your line and it worked!

678
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,381
- What line?
- Hello!

679
00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:26,013
Hello is not my line. Hello is not a line. Hello is hello.

680
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,000
Well all I know is I hello-d him today and now he's taking me to dinner.

681
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:29,853
Mom...

682
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:32,972
If you don't get over here right now I'm going to book a DAR function

683
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,286
at the Dragonfly every single weekend from now until I die!

684
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:37,176
I'll be right there!

685
00:32:38,974 --> 00:32:42,351
Mom? Are you... Oh! Chanel attack!

686
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,015
- Look at the red pant suit.
- The...

687
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,967
The red pant suit. The red pant suit. Right there, right there!

688
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:49,913
I got it, I got it.

689
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:51,363
Here.

690
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:53,283
- Well?
- Nice.

691
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:58,773
- Nice?
- Uh, nice and... red and pant-y suit-y.

692
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,723
- It's horrible. You think it's horrible.
- No.

693
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,948
It's horrible, and Simon will be here in twenty minutes and I have nothing to wear.

694
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:06,709
Well, just tell him you're obsessed with Butterfield 8, and go like that.

695
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:10,390
I haven't done this in years. I have no idea what's appropriate to wear on the first date.

696
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,668
I have no idea what's appropriate to say on the first date.

697
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:14,809
I have no idea what to talk about, what to order. Which one?

698
00:33:15,423 --> 00:33:18,080
- They look exactly the same.
- They are not exactly the same!

699
00:33:18,238 --> 00:33:21,319
Okay. Then... that one.

700
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:22,554
- Why?
- Why what?

701
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:27,060
Why did you pick that one? What was your logic behind picking this particular one?

702
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:29,374
Could it possibly be because it was closest?

703
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:31,018
Well, you know what they say about location.

704
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,466
You're just picking anything so that I will get dressed so you can leave.

705
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,534
No, Mom, I don't want to leave.

706
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:38,342
I'm never leaving, in fact, I'm going with you.

707
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,681
I'll never be ready in time. I haven't finished my hair, I haven't finished my makeup.

708
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:45,656
Oh my goodness, I can't breathe.

709
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:48,232
- I'm actually having trouble breathing.
- Mom, sit.

710
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:51,605
- I can't sit! I'll wrinkle my clothes!
- You're not dressed yet.

711
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:54,212
What? Oh my God, I'm losing my mind.

712
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:58,195
I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm dating. I'm single.

713
00:33:58,283 --> 00:33:59,527
You're not single!

714
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:01,579
That's just a formality.

715
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:05,440
You know, I remember the night I got married. Oh, how I panicked.

716
00:34:05,788 --> 00:34:10,577
I thought, this is it. I'll never have a chance to be with anyone else. This is it for life.

717
00:34:10,933 --> 00:34:14,307
If only I'd had a crystal ball I'd have been able to eat my salad.

718
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,429
I remember it looked delicious.

719
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:20,190
Mom, is this really what you want to do?

720
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,822
Yes it is.

721
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,712
Okay.

722
00:34:28,163 --> 00:34:29,612
Wear the black.

723
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:31,665
Thank you.

724
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,585
- What about the...
- Burgundy works fine, too.

725
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:47,326
Jackson! Jackson, stop!

726
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:50,788
Oh, Jackson, oh thank God, I'm frantic!

727
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:53,593
- What's the matter?
- My accompanist just passed out.

728
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:54,301
She what?

729
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:58,314
She was playing the Tarantella and suddenly she just stopped and fell off the stool! Come on.

730
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,005
- Well, is she breathing?
- I don't know.

731
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:02,830
- Did you check her pulse?
- No! What a good idea,

732
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:04,801
- oh you're such a smart man.
- Oh, well...

733
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:07,803
A little faster, honey, the poor woman is just lying there.

734
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,559
Well maybe we should call 9-1-1.

735
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:13,317
She's right over there in the corner.

736
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:14,996
Why is it so dark in here?

737
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:22,644
The town meeting is now in session.

738
00:35:30,198 --> 00:35:31,815
We work pretty good together.

739
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,758
I guess.

740
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:34,570
Don't guess, we do.

741
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:37,791
We got like a rhythm. A groove thing.

742
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,598
We could survive in the woods together.

743
00:35:39,952 --> 00:35:41,988
Start a new civilization if need be.

744
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:43,437
I think you'd need a woman for that.

745
00:35:43,524 --> 00:35:45,942
Aw, right. Well, maybe Liz could come.

746
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:50,862
Except, we couldn't share her 'cause she's your sister. That's a bad way to start a new civilization.

747
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,831
How about you and Liz go start a new civilization, I'll stay here in this one.

748
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:56,530
No, come on. We can solve this.

749
00:35:56,785 --> 00:36:00,657
Okay, Lorelai could come. And now her, we could share.

750
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:04,594
- Okay, no more new civilization talk.
- Okay by me.

751
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:08,305
Hey TJ.

752
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:09,458
Yes, Luke.

753
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:11,859
Do you consider yourself a jealous man?

754
00:36:12,228 --> 00:36:14,834
Why, you planning on cutting some pipe with another guy tomorrow?

755
00:36:14,927 --> 00:36:16,779
- Never mind.
- I'm sorry.

756
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:20,855
You were asking me if I ever consider myself a jealous man.

757
00:36:21,147 --> 00:36:26,728
I don't, and let me tell you why. Jealousy is bad. Jealousy is what landed me in jail.

758
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:30,507
Twice. I learned quickly that without an immediate influx of cash I could

759
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:34,981
no longer afford to be a jealous man. Supply and demand, my friend.

760
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:40,711
So you're saying that if Liz had lunch with an ex, it's no big deal, right?

761
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:41,408
Right.

762
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:44,761
Right. I mean, it's an old ex. Long time ago, ancient history.

763
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:50,219
But she had lunch and she didn't tell you about it at the time, but eventually she did tell you,

764
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:55,257
I mean, you should just let it go, right? I mean, you don't want to be reading anything into anything.

765
00:36:55,502 --> 00:37:00,013
You'd just make yourself crazy, and then she's crazy, then everybody's crazy, right?

766
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:03,572
- Who the hell is Liz having lunch with?
- What, no one!

767
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,722
- You just said she had lunch with an ex!
- Naw, TJ...

768
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:09,158
- Was it Art? I swear to God, if it's Art I'm gonna...
- Hey, what are you doing?

769
00:37:09,224 --> 00:37:11,385
I told him never to come sniffing around here again!

770
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:14,600
TJ! Hey, it wasn't Art!

771
00:37:16,552 --> 00:37:21,368
I have to tell you, every time I hear Moller's Seventh Symphony, I get ridiculous.

772
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:24,015
Giddy. It's like the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show.

773
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:25,638
Well, Moller can do that to you.

774
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,833
Did you see the Cleveland Orchestra when they were here last month?

775
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,533
I went every single night.

776
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:32,638
Oh, I should've done that.

777
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:35,281
I went the last night and then to the gala afterward.

778
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:37,440
- Their conductor that night...
- Ridalsky.

779
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,340
Did you know that he's deaf in his left ear?

780
00:37:39,495 --> 00:37:44,721
I did know that. In fact, I have a very evil friend who likes to sit next to him

781
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:50,358
at all the gala dinners and whisper incredibly scandalous things into his ear all night long.

782
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:53,456
Well, who knew that Emily Gilmore ran with such a bad crowd?

783
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,564
Oh, yes, I'm very dangerous. Ask my maids.

784
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:59,621
Have I told you how happy I am you said hello to me at the club?

785
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:00,359
Twice.

786
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:01,961
And so am I.

787
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,464
How are we doing here?

788
00:38:05,073 --> 00:38:06,138
We're doing fine.

789
00:38:06,406 --> 00:38:07,602
Would you like some more wine?

790
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:09,882
Why not.

791
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:18,918
- Okay, so you know what's great about this country?
- Nope.

792
00:38:19,107 --> 00:38:24,335
If you try hard enough, you can eventually find a showing of St. Elmo's Fire on the big screen.

793
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,187
Yes, that's what gets us the good seats at the summits.

794
00:38:27,443 --> 00:38:29,553
Come on! Admit it!

795
00:38:29,846 --> 00:38:33,296
Rob Lowe pretending to play the saxophone was incredibly hot.

796
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:34,519
Oh, I admit it.

797
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:39,685
And, also, Andrew McCarthy at his best, though Less Than Zero runs a very close second.

798
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:42,153
I'm sure it does.

799
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,488
You hated the movie!

800
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:49,039
Although, I love the fact that it got me out of a town meeting, so...

801
00:38:49,332 --> 00:38:51,698
all in all, a very successful evening.

802
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,553
Are you sure you can't stay?

803
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:07,763
I've got really early deliveries tomorrow.

804
00:39:08,163 --> 00:39:09,842
I'll make it up to you this weekend.

805
00:39:10,072 --> 00:39:11,379
I'll hold you to that, mister.

806
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:22,798
Oh, by the way. It's fine about lunch.

807
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:23,512
What?

808
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,160
You having lunch with Christopher, I just want you to know I'm fine with it.

809
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:29,070
Oh, okay. Good.

810
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,532
Yep, all right. See you tomorrow.

811
00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:43,298
- Breaking your fast?
- Oh my God. I love food, you want some?

812
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:45,023
- I'm good...
- Oh, it's for me, it's for me.

813
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:47,895
- Pizza.
- Yes, yes.

814
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:49,508
- Thirty-four ninety five.
- Need some money?

815
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:52,043
No, I got it. You want to have some? There's plenty.

816
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:53,363
No, thanks. I'm going to Marty's.

817
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:54,094
Okay.

818
00:39:58,513 --> 00:39:59,885
Well, where's the cheesy bread?

819
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:01,810
I ordered the cheesy bread!

820
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:06,542
Okay. I remember something about Rome.

821
00:40:06,966 --> 00:40:09,870
Rome. Rome.

822
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,138
Romans live there.

823
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:17,770
Audrey Hepburn took a holiday there. It's the name of a B52's song.

824
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:18,963
Different Roam.

825
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:23,392
Okay. That's it. I can't remember. College is breaking my spirit.

826
00:40:23,478 --> 00:40:27,504
Every single day telling me things I don't know, it's making me feel stupid.

827
00:40:27,846 --> 00:40:29,602
Okay, I need a break.

828
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:30,919
I second that.

829
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:32,967
Oh, man, I'm tired.

830
00:40:33,382 --> 00:40:34,809
Living is exhausting.

831
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:37,303
This week sucked, I'm so glad it's over.

832
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:38,256
Why'd it suck?

833
00:40:38,425 --> 00:40:40,739
Just a ton of school work, Ramadan.

834
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:41,476
Oh, sure.

835
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:43,253
I broke up with my boyfriend this week.

836
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:47,400
That was fun. In front of a bunch of people at my grandmother's house.

837
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,420
And then, because apparently that wasn't enough Peyton Place for me,

838
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:53,860
I have this whole thing going with my dad,

839
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,201
who's suddenly back in my life again.

840
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,650
Yeah. Dads can be tough.

841
00:40:57,762 --> 00:41:02,181
I spent so many years just - I couldn't wait until he showed up.

842
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:04,438
And now he's showing up. And...

843
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:09,248
I don't know. I'm just really tired.

844
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:14,649
You know, once I found out my father wasn't really my father,

845
00:41:15,144 --> 00:41:16,932
we started getting along much better.

846
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:17,952
Stop it.

847
00:41:18,227 --> 00:41:21,175
I'm serious. Suddenly the pressure was off.

848
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:25,026
If something happens I don't automatically have to give him a kidney.

849
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:27,003
I can weigh my options.

850
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,783
It was a real turning point in our relationship.

851
00:41:31,796 --> 00:41:34,222
So you broke up with your boyfriend, huh?

852
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:36,188
Rory?

853
00:41:54,836 --> 00:41:57,232
"I'm exhausted, the phone is far, make it short and sweet. "

854
00:41:57,862 --> 00:42:00,765
Hey Lor, it's me. Are you there?

855
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:06,571
Okay, so I'm just calling 'cause lunch ended bad and I'm sure you've talked to Rory by now

856
00:42:06,644 --> 00:42:09,238
so you know why it ended bad and I just wanted to talk.

857
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:11,794
Give me a call when you get in, I'll be up late.

858
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:13,827
Okay. Bye.

859
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:25,967
It's been a long time since I've had an evening quite as enjoyable as this one.

860
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:29,960
I'm choosing to believe you, Simon, partly because it's flattering

861
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:33,570
and partly because I've had three glasses of wine and a lemon jell-o.

862
00:42:36,852 --> 00:42:39,585
So, do you think we could possibly do this again sometime?

863
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:42,141
That would be lovely, Simon.

864
00:42:42,222 --> 00:42:43,288
I'll call you this week.

865
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:44,916
Good night.

866
