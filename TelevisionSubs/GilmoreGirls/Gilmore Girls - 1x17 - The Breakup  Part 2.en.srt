1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,772
Tell me what happened.

2
00:00:05,856 --> 00:00:08,316
We just broke up.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,609
I don't understand.

4
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:14,071
We went to dinner,
and then we walked by the bonfire...

5
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:15,531
but it wasn't lit.

6
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:19,534
So we went to this junkyard,
and we sat in this car and... Oh, God!

7
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:22,579
- What?
- I forgot your meatball in the car.

8
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:24,039
Honey, forget it.

9
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:26,582
I can't believe
I left your meatball in the car.

10
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,334
Okay, come on.

11
00:00:28,418 --> 00:00:31,379
After I told the waiter to wrap it up
and everything.

12
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:34,423
And everyone was like,
'What do you want with one meatball?'

13
00:00:34,507 --> 00:00:36,425
I said, 'It's a mother-daughter thing. '

14
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,927
I'm sure he thought I was nuts,
but he was so nice.

15
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:40,971
And he did it anyway.

16
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,431
He brought one of those
little tinfoil swans or a duck...

17
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:48,102
or some kind of bird
and then I left it in the car.

18
00:00:48,186 --> 00:00:51,147
Forget about the meatball.
Just tell me what happened.

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,689
He just broke up with me.

20
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:56,067
This doesn't make any sense.
This is Dean we're talking about.

21
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:58,653
He's crazy about you.
He calls 25 times a day.

22
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:02,198
The cover of his notebook
is one step away from stalker material.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,241
- I have to go to bed.
- Wait.

24
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:06,493
- Take me through the night step by step.
- Why?

25
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:08,412
So I can help decipher
what happened here.

26
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:12,291
We broke up. He didn't wanna be
my boyfriend anymore, end of story.

27
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:14,292
- So not end of story.
- Yes, it is.

28
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:17,086
He did not plan a romantic evening
complete with dinner...

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,296
and a junkyard
which we'll get back to later...

30
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:22,008
- and then suddenly decide to dump you.
- How do you know?

31
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,678
I've read every Nancy Drew mystery,
the one about the Amish country, twice.

32
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,554
I know there's more to the story.

33
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:30,140
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of all his stuff.

34
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,934
- What stuff?
- Everything he gave me and touched.

35
00:01:33,018 --> 00:01:34,102
Everything he looked at.

36
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:36,646
Will you just calm down
for just one second?

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,523
He doesn't wanna be my boyfriend, fine.

38
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,149
Okay, it will be fine, but...

39
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,484
- What?
- Mine.

40
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,321
- Is there someone else?
- No.

41
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:47,364
- Is he moving?
- No.

42
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:50,408
Is he dying?
Did his football team lose a game?

43
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:52,410
- What?
- It's happened.

44
00:01:52,494 --> 00:01:55,997
- Did he try something?
- What?

45
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:58,541
- Did he want to...
- What?

46
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,960
Did he want to go faster than you?

47
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:03,378
- God, no!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

48
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:06,172
You're just not giving me
much to go off of here.

49
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:08,425
That's your fancy dress
that I made for you.

50
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,386
That I wore to a dance
that I went to with him.

51
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,637
The sweater's brand-new.

52
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:17,058
- He saw me in it yesterday and liked it.
- Then he's got good taste.

53
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,393
He said it brought out the blue in my eyes.

54
00:02:19,435 --> 00:02:20,727
Then he's gay.

55
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,105
- You're not funny and it goes.
- I'm a little funny.

56
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,357
If you throw away everything
he saw you wear...

57
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:28,235
you're gonna be walking around
in a towel.

58
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:32,572
Colonel Clucker? Are you serious?
He has been with you since you were four.

59
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:35,073
The first time Dean came over,
he picked it up.

60
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:36,492
That's not the Colonel's fault.

61
00:02:36,576 --> 00:02:39,578
He was sitting, minding his own business,
and a guy picks him up.

62
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:40,871
What's a stuffed bird to do?

63
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:43,790
I don't want to joke about this, not now.

64
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:46,501
Here, I don't want to look at that anymore.

65
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:50,254
- I'll put it away.
- No, take it out of the house.

66
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,425
Throw it in a dumpster, burn it,
I don't care. I want it gone.

67
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,304
Someday when this is all in the past...

68
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,765
you may be sorry
you don't have those things.

69
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,892
I don't care!

70
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,269
- Okay, fine. It's gone.
- Thank you.

71
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,356
I'll take care of it, and you go to bed.
Get some rest.

72
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,401
Maybe you'll feel more like talking
in the morning.

73
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,486
Honey, good night.

74
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,866
- Mom.
- Yeah.

75
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,452
Far, far away from the house, okay?

76
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:27,455
- Hey, it sleeps with the fishes.
- Thank you.

77
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:53,700
Mom, get up.

78
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:58,663
- Rory, what's the matter?
- Nothing. I just want to get started.

79
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:01,707
I listed all the things
we say we're gonna do on weekends...

80
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,917
but when it comes around...

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,752
you say they're too boring
to actually do on a weekend day.

82
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:09,756
Then you say we'll do them during
the week which, of course, we never do.

83
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,885
I think we should get them
all out of the way today once and for all.

84
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:18,221
And to make it interesting,
we should come up with a reward system.

85
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,807
So once we're done with everything
on the list...

86
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,600
we could go get manicures.

87
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:26,229
Or we could go to that Swiss place
for fondue for dinner...

88
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:30,358
or we could stuff our purses
full of Sour Patch Kids and Milk Duds...

89
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,277
and go see the Stars Hollow
elementary school production...

90
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:35,696
of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

91
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,489
- It's 6:00.
- I know.

92
00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:39,741
- On Saturday morning.
- That's right.

93
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,410
It's 6:00 on Saturday morning!

94
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:45,830
- Do you want to wear docks or sneakers?
- I want to wear slippers.

95
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:48,583
- Up, please!
- Rory, my heart.

96
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,794
- It is Saturday, the day of rest.
- Sunday is the day of rest.

97
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,840
- No, Saturday is the day of pre-rest.
- Pre-rest?

98
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,425
Yeah, so that way
when you actually get to Sunday...

99
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,219
you're rested enough to enjoy your rest.

100
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:02,929
That makes absolutely no sense.

101
00:06:03,013 --> 00:06:05,682
That's because it's 6:00
on Saturday morning.

102
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,725
- Oh, jeez!
- Up, please!

103
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:10,770
- You made a rhyme.
- I'll see you downstairs.

104
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:40,379
- Hello. Did you rearrange the furniture?
- Yes.

105
00:06:40,463 --> 00:06:43,549
Good. I thought we were having
a problem with decorator elves.

106
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:47,928
I was gonna have to call an exterminator
and tent the place. But it was just you.

107
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:51,306
So was there any reason
that you suddenly felt the need...

108
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:53,975
to move around large pieces of furniture
in the morning?

109
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:58,146
- I was up. It was there.
- Okay, good thought process. Great.

110
00:06:59,022 --> 00:07:02,108
Now I noticed that
you didn't move the TV though.

111
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:04,151
- It was too heavy.
- Right, okay.

112
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,821
Well, I like this. This is good.

113
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:10,448
Of course when the sofa faced the TV,
it was a little easier to watch.

114
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:14,285
But this is good, too. It'll be like radio.

115
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:17,955
- Are you ready to go?
- I am. Just one quick sec.

116
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:21,334
Why don't you...
Could you put the pen down?

117
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,876
I'm just finishing the list.

118
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,587
Yes, I see. As much as I love your list...

119
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:29,841
let's just finish this particular one
in a little while, okay?

120
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Okay.

121
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,179
I'm concerned about you.
I wish you would talk to me.

122
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,681
I don't want to deal with it right now.

123
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,475
I can't deal with it right now.

124
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,979
Fair enough. But listen,
I've had my heart broken before.

125
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:46,105
It's really hard.

126
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,776
It's hard for everyone,
so can I give you a little advice?

127
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,027
Okay.

128
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,905
I think what you really need
to do today is wallow.

129
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:57,199
- Wallow?
- Yeah. Get back in your pajamas...

130
00:07:57,241 --> 00:08:00,702
go to bed, eat nothing but gallons
of ice cream and tons of pizza...

131
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:04,622
don't take a shower, or shave your legs,
or put on any kind of makeup at all.

132
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:07,875
Just sit in the dark, watch a sad movie
and have a good long cry...

133
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:10,128
and just wallow. You need to wallow.

134
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:13,547
- No.
- Rory, your first love is intense...

135
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:16,383
and your first breakup even more intense.

136
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:20,803
Shoving it away and ignoring it
while you make lists is not going to help.

137
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,680
I don't want to wallow.

138
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:25,183
- Try it for one day.
- No.

139
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:27,227
One day of pizza and pajamas.

140
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,647
I'll rent Love Story and The Champ,
An Affair to Remember, Ishtar.

141
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:35,067
- I don't want to be that kind of girl.
- The kind who watches Ishtar?

142
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,028
The girl who falls apart
because she doesn't have a boyfriend.

143
00:08:38,112 --> 00:08:39,571
That hardly applies to you.

144
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:41,948
- It will, if I wallow.
- Not true.

145
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:45,785
So I used to have a boyfriend
and now I don't.

146
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:47,954
That's just the way it is.

147
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:50,163
Sitting in the dark eating junk food...

148
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:53,000
and not shaving my legs
isn't gonna change that, is it?

149
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,794
- No.
- So I don't even want to go there.

150
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:59,715
I have things to do.
I have school and Harvard to think about.

151
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,590
Harvard's three years away.

152
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,344
But now is the time to be preparing for it.

153
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:07,096
I mean, Harvard is hard to get into...

154
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:10,557
and I don't know why I even spend
my time thinking about anything else.

155
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,100
Because you have a pulse.

156
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,602
And you're not the president
of the audiovisual club.

157
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,772
I'm 16. I have the rest of my life
to have a boyfriend.

158
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:20,108
I should be keeping my eye
on the prize right now.

159
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,443
- I admire your attitude.
- Thank you.

160
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:25,779
So should we rent Old Yeller, too?
Or is it just a guy's crying movie?

161
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:27,072
You're not listening to me.

162
00:09:27,156 --> 00:09:29,950
I am listening to you.
I just don't agree with you.

163
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:32,619
I don't want to wallow,
and you can't make me.

164
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,621
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

165
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,999
- So that must be the list.
- Yes, it is.

166
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,876
May I see it, please?

167
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:46,423
- We do not need a garden hose.
- We don't have one.

168
00:09:46,507 --> 00:09:47,924
We don't have a garden either.

169
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:49,968
But maybe if we have a hose,
we can grow one.

170
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:51,678
- Could I see the pen for a sec?
- Why?

171
00:09:51,762 --> 00:09:53,388
Small adjustment.

172
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,605
It's on the list.
Don't you have to do it if it's there?

173
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:04,856
I am not going to wallow.

174
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,734
But I put it after going
to the recycling center.

175
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:10,946
What are these people doing up?
It's Saturday morning.

176
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:13,156
- Some people like getting up early.
- You lie.

177
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,074
- No, they do it voluntarily.
- Really?

178
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,118
- Every day.
- Jump back.

179
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,243
Excuse me?

180
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:21,497
Kevin Bacon in Footloose,
reaction to the no-dancing-in-town rule...

181
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,999
as revealed by Chris Penn,
Sean's brother, sage to all.

182
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,502
You should have known
what they teach you in that damn school.

183
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,506
- What?
- I can't go that way.

184
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,341
- Why, we're going to Luke's.
- No.

185
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,635
You pulled me out of bed at 6:00 a. M...

186
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,637
and then you say no to Luke's?
Don't you know that's dangerous?

187
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,389
- I can't go that way.
- Reason, please?

188
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,558
- We'd have to go by Doose's market.
- So?

189
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:45,602
- So we might run into...
- Oh, right.

190
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,562
You don't know if he's working?

191
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,064
I don't remember.
His weekend schedule changes a lot.

192
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:51,524
We'll just take the long way.

193
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:54,443
- No, we'd have to go by the school.
- There's no school today.

194
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:57,446
On his days off,
he plays football there with his friends.

195
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,448
- Well, what time?
- It varies.

196
00:11:00,115 --> 00:11:03,618
We'll just go down Peach, circle around...
You're shaking your head, why?

197
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:04,994
Dean lives on Peach.

198
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:06,746
Rory, honey, love of my life...

199
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,082
you realize you've cut us off from Luke's
where the happy coffee is.

200
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,584
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

201
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,047
We'll figure something out.

202
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,592
- Sorry.
- No, this is good.

203
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:23,136
It's like G.I. Jane,
but we get to keep our hair.

204
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,722
- I just couldn't.
- Honey, say no more.

205
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,348
Think of this as an adventure.

206
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:30,142
Two girls battling the elements,
desperate for survival.

207
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:32,102
- Or coffee.
- Same thing.

208
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,939
I bet you can tell a lot about people
from their garbage.

209
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:39,692
Think about it. Trash is discarded aspects
of people's lives.

210
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:42,528
It talks about their eating habits,
what they read...

211
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:44,697
do they go to concerts,
are they responsible...

212
00:11:44,781 --> 00:11:46,574
do they pay their bills on time?

213
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:49,994
You know that trash doesn't actually talk
unless it's on Sesame Street.

214
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,411
I'm just trying to make a point.

215
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,371
That going through garbage is interesting.

216
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:55,581
- And educational.
- And stinky and a little nuts.

217
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,793
There's nothing nuts about wanting
to know more about human nature.

218
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:02,838
- Curiosity is how we grow.
- We need to get you out of this alley.

219
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,470
- Who are all these people?
- It's the 6:00 a. m. Crowd.

220
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:13,097
I officially recognize nobody in this place.

221
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,560
- Coffee while you wait?
- Bless you.

222
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:19,771
So Luke put you to work?

223
00:12:19,813 --> 00:12:22,565
I figured if I'm hanging around here
for a while...

224
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,150
the least I could do is help out.

225
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:27,235
So you're gonna be hanging around
for a while here?

226
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:28,654
Yeah, I think so.

227
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:31,072
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

228
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:33,449
So where is Luke?

229
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:36,869
We were kind of up late last night,
so I let him sleep in.

230
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:38,496
Sleep in? Luke?

231
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,123
Believe me, it wasn't easy
to get him to agree to it...

232
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:45,460
but in the end, a little sweet talk,
a couple Excedrin PMs, he finally caved.

233
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,463
- There's a seat over there.
- Great.

234
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:50,965
- Go! I'll be over in a sec.
- Okay.

235
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:57,388
I feel like everyone is staring at me.

236
00:12:57,472 --> 00:13:00,141
Yeah, because you've got a banana peel
stuck to your foot.

237
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,975
- I do?
- I'm kidding.

238
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:05,187
- Nobody's staring at you.
- They know.

239
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,272
- They don't know.
- It's probably all around town by now.

240
00:13:08,315 --> 00:13:10,817
It just happened last night.
It's 6:00 in the morning.

241
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:13,444
Everyone knows that I've been dumped.

242
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:16,989
- Do you want to go home?
- No, we have a list.

243
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:19,450
Okay. Great.
I'm gonna order us something.

244
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,160
Any preferences?
Eggs, French toast, key to the dumpster?

245
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,620
- I don't care.
- I'll be right back.

246
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:29,584
Lorelai, what a nice surprise
so early in the morning.

247
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,044
So how's things?

248
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,419
You know, don't you?

249
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:35,797
Yes, and I feel awful.
I feel completely responsible.

250
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:36,882
You should.

251
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,968
I got Dean that job,
and I certainly encouraged them.

252
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,137
I felt they were so right together.

253
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,597
Please don't say anything to Rory about it.

254
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,849
She's concerned
about everybody finding out.

255
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,351
Of course. Not a peep.

256
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:51,228
- And spread the word, okay?
- Consider it done.

257
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:54,231
Would you give the angel a hug for me?

258
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:57,818
You don't have to say it's from me.
Just give her a hug.

259
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:59,403
- Got it.
- Okay.

260
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,201
Good morning, sleeping beauty.

261
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,703
Rachel thought I looked a little tired.

262
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:12,790
- No, it's good. You need a little break.
- I guess.

263
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:14,040
You do.

264
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:17,002
She seems pretty comfortable here?

265
00:14:17,044 --> 00:14:21,840
She always could just fit in places,
you know. It's a talent of hers.

266
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,553
- She looks good in your apron.
- Yeah, can I get you anything?

267
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:32,266
Do you think you can make
those crazy chocolate chip pancakes...

268
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,350
and go extra heavy on the chocolate?

269
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:36,394
Yeah, sure. Any special occasion?

270
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,270
- Dean broke up with Rory.
- What?

271
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,398
Quiet. She doesn't want anybody to know.

272
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:43,651
I knew it. I knew that kid was trouble.

273
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:46,028
Yes, you did. You knew it.
Pancakes, please.

274
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,404
God, he's got a nerve.

275
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:49,823
What does he think?
He's gonna do better than Rory?

276
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,701
Is he crazy? Jeez. All right, forget it.

277
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:56,997
Good riddance, adios, bienvenidos,
hasta la vista.

278
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,623
Could we get off the Small World ride
and get cooking?

279
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:03,002
- How is she?
- She's been dumped by her first boyfriend.

280
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:06,505
Man, I swear I would love to...

281
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:11,385
Okay, I'm gonna put some whipped cream
on the pancakes, too.

282
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,387
Thank you, Luke.

283
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,513
- Not a word, okay?
- I got it.

284
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:17,974
I never liked him.
I don't know exactly what it was.

285
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:20,767
Something about the shape
of his forehead...

286
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:23,646
or his height or the floppy hairstyle.

287
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:26,815
Actually, on reflection,
I think it was the floppy hairstyle.

288
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,108
Good morning, Kirk.

289
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,153
I want to express my apologies
for not voicing my concerns...

290
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:35,656
about that floppy-haired jerk earlier,
because if I had...

291
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,325
You know what, you need to leave now.

292
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:40,703
I cannot go until you accept my apology.

293
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:43,038
- I accept your apology.
- All right.

294
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:47,042
- It will not happen again.
- Okay.

295
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:49,085
Thank you.

296
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:52,129
Honey, are you sure you don't want to...

297
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:56,258
- Do not say wallow.
- Swallow your coffee before you eat?

298
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:59,428
- I am fine.
- But if you could see the look on your face.

299
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,681
It's the same look you had on your face
when you broke up with Max.

300
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:05,142
Did wallowing help you get over him?

301
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:08,352
I'm not saying wallowing
will help you get over Dean.

302
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:10,437
It's part of the process.

303
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:13,857
It's the mourning period.
It's a step, an important step.

304
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,526
The only thing
that'll get you over somebody is time.

305
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,696
How much time did it take you
to get over Max?

306
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,489
- I'm not sure exactly.
- Approximately?

307
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:23,783
- I didn't clock it.
- Ballpark figure?

308
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:25,034
- A while.
- Be vaguer.

309
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,410
Rory, come on.

310
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:29,289
More coffee?
Pancakes are coming right up.

311
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,957
- Anything else I can get you?
- No, thanks.

312
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,710
I've got some strawberries back there.
You like strawberries, don't you?

313
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:39,006
- I like strawberries but...
- I'm getting you strawberries.

314
00:16:40,757 --> 00:16:44,260
- You told him, didn't you?
- No. Miss Patty did.

315
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:47,888
- Who told Miss Patty?
- I don't know, numerous sources.

316
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:53,601
- Stop right there.
- What?

317
00:16:53,686 --> 00:16:55,062
- Where you going?
- To get coffee.

318
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:56,145
- Wrong.
- Excuse me.

319
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,022
- You're not going in.
- What are you saying?

320
00:16:58,106 --> 00:16:59,232
Turn around, bag boy.

321
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,442
- Are you serious?
- You see a smile on this face?

322
00:17:01,526 --> 00:17:04,695
- No, but what's different about that?
- What's that supposed to mean?

323
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:07,115
You're not exactly known
as the town crackup.

324
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:08,490
So you're a smart guy now?

325
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,700
What the hell are you doing?

326
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:11,618
Exercising my right not to serve you.

327
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:14,829
What are you talking about?
I'm not even inside yet.

328
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:16,331
- Let go of me!
- You first!

329
00:17:16,373 --> 00:17:19,042
If you tell Miss Patty,
everybody in town's gonna know.

330
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:21,503
People have their own lives and problems.

331
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:26,006
I hardly think you and Dean breaking up
is the main thing on their minds.

332
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,092
- Oh, my God!
- What?

333
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:30,719
Oh, my God.

334
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:33,388
Cut it out! Break it up!

335
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:34,806
What are you doing?

336
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,351
Back off! Come here.
What do you think you're doing?

337
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:40,186
- He started it.
- By doing what?

338
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:43,147
- He was coming in.
- Are you a lunatic! He's 16!

339
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,523
What was I supposed to do?

340
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,942
Stand in the street
and have a slap fight, of course.

341
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:48,193
Come here.

342
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,487
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

343
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:54,157
Good. I don't know what got into Luke.
He's usually so...

344
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,450
I have to go.

345
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,785
Sure. Bye.

346
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,122
- Get inside now. Inside. Now!
- He started it.

347
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,469
- So where's that list?
- What?

348
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,346
The list. We've got a lot to do today.

349
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:20,263
Otherwise I'll be dragging your butt...

350
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,641
out of bed
at 6:00 again tomorrow morning.

351
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:24,726
So where do we start?

352
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:32,108
We need a soap dish for the kitchen.

353
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:34,444
A kitchen soap dish.

354
00:18:34,486 --> 00:18:37,405
Quite decadent, but what the hell?
Let's go.

355
00:18:40,491 --> 00:18:43,952
- That was a very successful outing for us.
- Yes, it was.

356
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:47,163
We got everything
except for the brown extension cord.

357
00:18:47,247 --> 00:18:48,414
Which will be in on Tuesday.

358
00:18:48,457 --> 00:18:52,085
- So I think that qualifies as a check, too.
- Are you happy?

359
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:54,253
I appreciate a job well done, yeah.

360
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:58,215
I can't wait to try the toaster pizza.
It looks so gross...

361
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:00,384
which is usually the mark
of a great junk food.

362
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:01,634
- Beefaroni.
- Enough said.

363
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:03,637
I'm gonna plug in
my new wall air freshener.

364
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,889
Give me five minutes
and then come sniff my room.

365
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:07,681
- Cheese or pepperoni?
- Whatever.

366
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:09,392
Both. Good choice.

367
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,688
Sugar, I just heard. Where is she?
Poor little thing.

368
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:17,274
- Rory, sweetie!
- Come on.

369
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:18,942
Is she outside?

370
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:23,154
Babbette, I appreciate you
coming over like this...

371
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:25,615
but Rory's not really
in a talking mood just now.

372
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:27,283
- But I can help!
- I know.

373
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,369
I can tell her how to go through
a lot of bad relationships...

374
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:33,497
- to get to that really good one!
- It's very good advice.

375
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:37,042
And I can tell her about all
the horrible men I've known in my day.

376
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:41,046
Really truly awful men.
I was pushed out of a moving car once.

377
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:43,631
- That's a peppy little anecdote.
- Let me tell her.

378
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,717
I want you to tell her all that
but just not right now.

379
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:48,177
Is she really bad?

380
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:52,305
She'll be fine. Really.

381
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:49,315
- They had some of our mail.
- Look.

382
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:54,070
- 'Madeline's having a party. '
- I'm going to go.

383
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:57,030
- You're going to a Chilton party?
- Yes, I am.

384
00:20:57,198 --> 00:21:00,159
Why don't you stay home
and read The Bell Jar? Same effect.

385
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:03,621
I'll be going to school there
for the next two-and-a-half years.

386
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:07,165
It wouldn't kill me to be social.
Right? What's wrong with that?

387
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:08,500
Nothing.

388
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,585
Okay, then it's settled.

389
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:14,338
- Can I make a suggestion?
- Go ahead.

390
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,382
Why don't you see
if Lane can come with you?

391
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:18,926
If the socializing doesn't turn out
how you planned...

392
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,344
you got a friendly face around.

393
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:23,097
- Okay, good idea. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

394
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:24,430
- Can I take the car?
- Yes.

395
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:26,099
- Can I borrow something to wear?
- Yes.

396
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:29,102
You gonna give in to anything
'cause you feel sorry for me?

397
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:30,728
I'll make a list.

398
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,521
- Here, hand me that blush.
- Okay.

399
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,606
Am I all twisty back here?

400
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,067
A little. Here.

401
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:40,737
So how are you?

402
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,155
I'm fine.

403
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:44,865
How are you really?

404
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,784
Life goes on, right?

405
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,954
I saw Dean today,
I wasn't sure if I should tell you.

406
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:51,288
Why not?

407
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:55,751
- I wasn't sure you'd want to know.
- No, that's fine. What did he say?

408
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:59,046
Nothing. He crossed the street
as soon as I saw him.

409
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:04,967
But if it's any consolation,
he looked really sad.

410
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,970
I don't want him to be sad.

411
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:08,887
Are you sure you wanna go out tonight?

412
00:22:08,972 --> 00:22:11,015
Why does everyone keep asking me that?

413
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:14,059
Because you just broke up.
I'd be perfectly fine...

414
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:18,730
to just hang out here and listen to music,
talk, not talk, whatever.

415
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:21,024
No, I am not hanging out.

416
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:23,442
We're going to this party.

417
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:26,946
It's gonna be great.
I don't want to dwell on this. That's final.

418
00:22:26,988 --> 00:22:31,325
Don't argue with her, or you'll find yourself
the proud owner of three garden weasels.

419
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:33,535
Three, 'cause one's just not enough.

420
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,078
- Here, turn around.
- Why?

421
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:37,705
Fourteen hours of labor, that's why.

422
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:40,000
And hair.

423
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:43,752
What is this?

424
00:22:43,836 --> 00:22:46,338
I thought it would go with your dress,
and it does.

425
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:48,590
- It's pretty.
- It's really pretty.

426
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:51,092
Here is the phone and some mad money.

427
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:54,262
If you think you're not
gonna be home before 12:00, you call me.

428
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:55,680
We'll be back by 12:00.

429
00:22:55,764 --> 00:22:57,515
- Call me.
- Sorry.

430
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:03,104
The cornstarch.

431
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:04,146
What?

432
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:08,650
The cornstarch.
The first time Dean kissed me...

433
00:23:08,692 --> 00:23:11,527
I forgot to put it with the other things.
I'll throw it out.

434
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,405
Why don't you let me do that?
You guys get going, okay?

435
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:17,032
Okay, bye. Have fun.

436
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,119
Look in somebody's sock drawer.

437
00:23:20,203 --> 00:23:23,372
Rich people have hilarious sock drawers.
Be good.

438
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:11,374
- Lorelai, hey.
- I wanted to ask you if...

439
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,210
- Sure, whatever.
- Sookie, hello?

440
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:19,923
Hi. How are you?

441
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:22,217
Good, I'm fine.
How's that x-ray vision coming?

442
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:23,385
Jackson's inside.

443
00:24:23,468 --> 00:24:26,554
- Is he doing something dirty?
- He's making me dinner.

444
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:28,931
- That's so nice.
- Yeah, it is.

445
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:31,350
It really is, it's sweet. I'm just...

446
00:24:31,434 --> 00:24:33,310
- Do you hear something?
- Like what?

447
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:36,980
Like someone using the wrong size pan
to sweat the onions in.

448
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,816
No, nothing like that.

449
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,319
Okay, maybe I'm hearing things.
So, hi, how are you?

450
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:45,446
Fine. So I wanted to see...

451
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,782
Could you peek inside the kitchen
and tell me...

452
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:50,868
if the orange Le Creuset
is on the far left burner.

453
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:53,286
Why don't you just go in there?

454
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:56,456
I would, but Jackson kicked me out.

455
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,582
He did.

456
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,126
He won't let me back in there.
It's driving me crazy.

457
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,296
Maybe he just wants you to relax.
I wouldn't mind that, either.

458
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,424
Just take a peek for me, will you?
Tell him you want some water.

459
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:09,176
And here. Take a picture for me.

460
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:12,137
Sookie, I'm not spying on Jackson.

461
00:25:12,221 --> 00:25:14,931
What if he's using the wrong spoon
in the wrong sauce?

462
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,808
- Then the world as we know will end.
- I have to go in there.

463
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,435
You stay right where you are.

464
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:21,312
You're being unreasonable.

465
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,939
When a person offers
to make another person dinner...

466
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,275
because this person is a chef
and is always cooking for others...

467
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,611
that is what happens to be a nice gesture.

468
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,488
And when that person
accepts the first person's offer...

469
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,575
that means that the first person,
the one who offered to cook...

470
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,995
would actually be doing the cooking,
while the other person relaxed...

471
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,080
had some wine,
and stayed out of the kitchen!

472
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,791
I wasn't cooking. I was suggesting.

473
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,711
You suggested the ladle
right out of my hand four times!

474
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:50,297
I had to skim the top of the sauce or it...

475
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:52,924
Damn it, Sookie,
this is supposed to be romantic!

476
00:25:53,008 --> 00:25:55,260
- It is!
- Stay out of here.

477
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:58,554
I am cooking this meal alone.
I'm also cleaning up alone.

478
00:25:58,638 --> 00:26:00,139
- No.
- Yes.

479
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:03,183
But you don't know
how to load my dishwasher. I've a system.

480
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:04,685
I'll wing it.

481
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:08,856
There's a diagram in the pantry!
Use it! I'm begging you.

482
00:26:08,939 --> 00:26:12,358
I'm doing two loads just because I can!

483
00:26:12,442 --> 00:26:15,361
Honey, try to sit down and relax.
It's nice what he's doing.

484
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:18,822
I know, you're right. It is nice.

485
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:20,741
Okay. All right.

486
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:25,579
I'm sitting. I'm relaxing.
I'm focusing on you.

487
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:28,415
Good. Actually, I wanted
to ask you a favor.

488
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:31,167
- What?
- Could I take your car for a little while?

489
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,794
Rory's got mine,
and there's something I want to do.

490
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:35,504
Yeah, of course.

491
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:39,842
- What's so important?
- I'll tell you later.

492
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:41,760
It sounds so serious.

493
00:26:41,844 --> 00:26:43,845
I'll have it back to you as soon as I can.

494
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:47,348
- Take your time. I'm in for the night.
- Okay. Bye, hon.

495
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,354
What happened? What did you do?

496
00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:19,669
Lorelai, what...

497
00:27:19,753 --> 00:27:21,754
Rory and Dean broke up.

498
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:24,674
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:28,344
Rory and Dean broke up,
and she won't wallow.

500
00:27:28,428 --> 00:27:30,763
And I told her that she should wallow...

501
00:27:30,847 --> 00:27:34,266
because that's supposed
to help you get through the pain...

502
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,477
and then you can accept it,
and get over somebody...

503
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:39,437
and you can move on with your life.

504
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:44,066
And then she asked me
how long it was before I got over you.

505
00:27:44,109 --> 00:27:48,070
And I didn't know what to say
because I can't lie to her.

506
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:50,948
I realized that if I gave her
any time frame at all...

507
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:54,076
that I would be lying
because I'm not over you.

508
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,078
And I don't know
how long it will be before I am.

509
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,456
Who am I to teach her about healing,
moving on, and breakups?

510
00:28:00,498 --> 00:28:04,126
I might as well be teaching her
to eat fire or swallow a sword...

511
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,629
or put her legs behind her head
because at least that's a trade.

512
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:11,966
I mean, the first two. I don't know
about putting the legs behind your head.

513
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:15,387
But the point is
that I'm an idiot, and I'm a hypocrite.

514
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,638
And I really...

515
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:19,974
miss you.

516
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:27,105
- Do you want to come in?
- Yes. Please.

517
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,619
This is unbelievable.
My wedding won't be this big.

518
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,748
This is amazing! People live here?

519
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:47,374
This is Madeline's house.

520
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,168
Is this what
your grandparents' house looks like?

521
00:28:50,252 --> 00:28:53,671
No. I mean, it's big,
but it's not this Hearst Castle-y.

522
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:57,383
There should be a map or a tour guide
or Robin Leach or something.

523
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:00,719
- Lane, thanks for coming with me.
- Anytime.

524
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:04,222
- My God, there's a pool table.
- And a deejay.

525
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:07,100
It's like a teenage Sodom and Gomorrah.

526
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:11,854
You came!

527
00:29:12,522 --> 00:29:13,939
Who's watching the farm?

528
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:17,317
- Madeline, your house is beautiful.
- Thanks, it's my stepfather's.

529
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,777
So, where is he?

530
00:29:18,861 --> 00:29:22,948
- My stepfather? He's in Japan.
- Not your stepfather. Prince Charming.

531
00:29:23,032 --> 00:29:26,576
He didn't come.
His white horse was in the shop.

532
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,661
You guys didn't break up, did you?

533
00:29:28,703 --> 00:29:31,205
- Hi, I'm Lane.
- As in, walk down a?

534
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:33,541
- Yes, exactly.
- Hi, I'm Madeline.

535
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:36,419
So when does
the tour of the pool house start?

536
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:38,503
You've seen the pool house before.

537
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:41,298
But they haven't seen it at night, right?

538
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,217
Madeline, you are not confused.

539
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:47,929
Think, process, focus.

540
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,349
Bye.

541
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,685
- Later, Paris.
- No glove, no love.

542
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:55,978
Lovely.

543
00:29:57,646 --> 00:30:00,565
- I didn't think you were a party girl.
- I'm not usually.

544
00:30:00,607 --> 00:30:03,401
But I thought I might come by
and check it out.

545
00:30:03,443 --> 00:30:06,028
It's the same exact people
we see every day at school...

546
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:08,405
except now we get to see them dance.

547
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:10,574
So where is your boyfriend?

548
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:12,367
We broke up.

549
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:17,039
At least you had a boyfriend for a while.

550
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,125
Do you know which way
will lead us to some soda?

551
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,418
Keep up because I'm not turning around.

552
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:26,463
- You didn't exaggerate.
- Paris needs no embellishment.

553
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:33,303
All of this soda is French.

554
00:30:33,387 --> 00:30:37,098
Madeline's mother has a French fetish.
She's obsessed with all things French.

555
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,309
French wine, French food, French water,
French cellulite products.

556
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:43,604
- Why won't you answer me?
- Because you didn't say 'please. '

557
00:30:43,646 --> 00:30:45,731
Can we do this later?
There's a party going on.

558
00:30:45,815 --> 00:30:48,776
Tell me what you were doing
locked in the bathroom with Austin.

559
00:30:48,818 --> 00:30:50,486
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

560
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:51,778
- Yes.
- No.

561
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,323
Why don't you tell me what I was doing,
since you seem to know everything.

562
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:57,742
- You are my girlfriend.
- Now he is a caveman.

563
00:30:57,784 --> 00:31:00,745
What are you gonna do?
Knock me on my head with a club...

564
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:03,456
and then drag me back to your Porsche?

565
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,374
Summer, please.

566
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,543
Good song.

567
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:17,010
I just love that Summer, don't you?

568
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:19,345
9:45.

569
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:23,807
- Why do you keep checking your watch?
- My mom says I have to stay till 10:30.

570
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:26,476
Why would she care?

571
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,728
She thinks
I'm not enough of a people person.

572
00:31:28,812 --> 00:31:30,938
- Shocking?
- I'm floored.

573
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:34,108
I doubt highly that Madame Curie...

574
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,777
was voted 'most likely
to dress like Jennifer Lopez. '

575
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,113
- You want to be a scientist?
- Cancer research.

576
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:40,823
- Cool.
- Yeah.

577
00:31:41,157 --> 00:31:42,700
- Oh, no.
- What?

578
00:31:42,783 --> 00:31:45,410
It just figures that
the only Korean boy at this party...

579
00:31:45,494 --> 00:31:47,495
has his Korean-girl radar turned on.

580
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:51,791
- I'm Henry.
- I'm Lane. This is Rory and Paris.

581
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,543
- We've met.
- Hi, Paris.

582
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:57,337
- So would you like to dance?
- We're talking here.

583
00:31:57,422 --> 00:32:00,341
Yeah, but, I mean, one dance?

584
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:03,051
You can put the conversation on hold
for one dance.

585
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:05,428
Unless this is
a Mid-East Peace Talk conversation.

586
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:08,473
- One dance.
- A short one. No crazy dance mixes.

587
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:10,642
- Okay.
- Thank you.

588
00:32:12,227 --> 00:32:14,520
If I'm not back in one dance,
you're coming down...

589
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:17,648
with a really bad case of anything
that means we have to go home.

590
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,068
- Is it getting warm in here, or is it me?
- Thank you.

591
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:26,823
Unbelievable. She's here
five minutes, she has a date.

592
00:32:26,865 --> 00:32:31,285
I've been going to this school 9 years,
and I'm the French-soda monitor.

593
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,741
Just in case this comes up later,
I did not come here for this.

594
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:16,326
Okay, got it.

595
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:23,749
- This is crazy!
- No, it is. It's nuts.

596
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,460
I don't see you for months,
and then all of a sudden...

597
00:33:26,544 --> 00:33:27,753
Ding-dong, Avon lady.

598
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:29,880
- It's insane.
- Completely.

599
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,674
You do that so good.

600
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,594
- We got to get a grip.
- I thought that's what we're doing.

601
00:33:36,636 --> 00:33:39,305
You're gonna sit over there on that couch.

602
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:42,809
And I'm gonna sit over here on this chair...

603
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:44,977
far away from the couch.

604
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:48,272
And I'm gonna put this table
right in between us...

605
00:33:48,314 --> 00:33:51,483
just like that. Good, okay.

606
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:55,611
And we're gonna sit here
and talk about this calmly.

607
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:57,529
Sounds good.

608
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:00,324
- How you been?
- Really good.

609
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:02,409
- You look really good.
- So do you.

610
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:05,204
- I missed you.
- I'm glad.

611
00:34:05,454 --> 00:34:09,415
Otherwise that greeting there
would have been a little inappropriate.

612
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,586
Actually, I've been
thinking about us lately.

613
00:34:12,627 --> 00:34:13,627
You have?

614
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,087
- Haven't you?
- No.

615
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,299
- I haven't given it any thought at all.
- I'm flattered.

616
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:21,093
I needed not to give it any thought...

617
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,638
otherwise I would give it
too much thought and that would be hard.

618
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,514
So I just didn't deal.

619
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:30,185
- Like mother, like daughter, I guess.
- I understand.

620
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,979
With all the thought you've been giving,
have you come up with any solutions?

621
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:37,984
No. You're still Rory's mother,
and I'm still her teacher.

622
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:40,944
And we're still us. I got nothing.

623
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:46,491
- So nothing's changed?
- Nothing's changed.

624
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:50,328
I guess my coming here
was probably a bad idea.

625
00:34:50,495 --> 00:34:51,829
Probably.

626
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,500
Screw this!

627
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,271
- Am I sick yet?
- Not yet. It might just be allergies.

628
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:21,856
Keep me posted.

629
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:32,616
My watch stopped. What time is it?

630
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,701
- It's 10:35.
- Yes! Bye.

631
00:35:57,014 --> 00:35:58,348
Tristan, stop it.

632
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,642
You're making me chase you
around the whole party.

633
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:01,767
Just trying to have fun.

634
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:04,728
You won't talk to me or dance.
Why did you even come with me?

635
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:06,272
Stop yelling.

636
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:08,816
Summer, please, can we just go?

637
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:11,526
- Please.
- No. I'm sick of fighting with you.

638
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,404
I'm sick of hearing 20 times a day,
'You're my girlfriend. '

639
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:17,532
Could we do this where
a roomful of people aren't staring at us?

640
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:19,701
I think we should break up.

641
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:23,745
- I want to go outside and talk about this.
- Then go. Bye.

642
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,164
Summer, come on!

643
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:36,508
- I have a major problem.
- What?

644
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:38,676
Henry, the guy I have been dancing with.

645
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,762
Okay, he's really good in school.
He's gonna be a doctor.

646
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:43,097
Pediatrician, to be exact.

647
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:45,766
His parents are extremely involved
in their local church.

648
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,601
He himself helps out with Sunday school.

649
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:50,020
He speaks Korean fluently,
he respects his parents.

650
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:54,231
And he's also really cute, very funny,
and surprisingly interesting.

651
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:57,610
Lane, I'm sorry, but I'm totally failing
to see the problem here.

652
00:36:57,652 --> 00:37:00,029
I'm falling for a guy
my parents would approve of!

653
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:03,491
They'd love him! They'd go crazy!
There'd be dancing in the Kim house!

654
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:05,033
- Dancing!
- Really?

655
00:37:05,117 --> 00:37:08,578
Followed by a lot of praying.
But initially, there'd be dancing.

656
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:12,373
This is horrible. It can't happen.
I have to stop it. We need to go.

657
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:15,459
No, now. You need
to grab your stuff, we got to go.

658
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:17,377
Okay. Whatever you say.

659
00:37:17,462 --> 00:37:19,296
- Hey!
- Henry, hi!

660
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,506
Sorry, I've been
monopolizing Lane all night.

661
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,468
No, that's okay. I've had her for 15 years.
I'm actually a little sick of her.

662
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:27,596
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

663
00:37:27,971 --> 00:37:29,847
- We should go.
- You're going?

664
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:33,350
Yeah, I have to get home.
I have a very strict mother.

665
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:36,311
Sorry about that. You couldn't even stay
for one more dance?

666
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,438
- I don't think...
- Yes.

667
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,105
- Excuse me?
- One dance would be fine.

668
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,399
Great.

669
00:37:40,482 --> 00:37:41,941
I'll be back!

670
00:37:43,944 --> 00:37:46,738
I certainly did not come over here for that.

671
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,448
I know.

672
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:54,828
You are a wonderful man.

673
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:57,122
I know.

674
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:03,003
What happens now?

675
00:38:04,588 --> 00:38:06,089
I don't know.

676
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,009
It's late. I have to get Sookie's car back.

677
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,928
Wait a second.

678
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:17,682
So this is it? You leave,
and we forget this ever happened?

679
00:38:20,018 --> 00:38:21,144
No.

680
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,146
Then what?

681
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,857
I leave, and we go on with our lives...

682
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,193
and then at some point
we buy some soup.

683
00:38:31,237 --> 00:38:33,655
- What? Soup is good food.
- Stop.

684
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:38,076
I don't want to leave here
and forget this ever happened.

685
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:43,872
I want to think of a solution
that will make everything better.

686
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:46,709
And I've been racking my brain for an idea.

687
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:49,753
Hence the babbling
about soup being good food.

688
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:53,048
But I can't think of anything.

689
00:38:55,217 --> 00:38:57,177
I think we should talk.

690
00:38:58,053 --> 00:38:59,971
- What?
- On the phone.

691
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:03,223
You and me, about us, on a regular basis.

692
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:08,812
We're not gonna solve this thing
away from each other.

693
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:10,188
No, we're not.

694
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,565
And obviously,
we are not gonna solve this...

695
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:15,568
by not staying away from each other.

696
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:18,029
But we'll burn more calories.

697
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,992
- I want to solve this.
- So do I.

698
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:25,202
So we'll talk?

699
00:39:26,495 --> 00:39:27,871
We'll talk.

700
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,547
- I thought we were supposed to be talking.
- There's plenty of time for talk.

701
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:45,971
Sorry.

702
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,264
No problem.

703
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:49,641
I'm sorry.

704
00:39:50,642 --> 00:39:53,102
- About what?
- About you and Summer.

705
00:39:53,436 --> 00:39:55,771
I don't want to talk about Summer.

706
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,774
How did you do on that biology test?

707
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,443
What?

708
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:04,404
The test. It was hard, wasn't it?

709
00:40:04,905 --> 00:40:06,573
Yeah, it was hard.

710
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,242
I got a B plus.

711
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:12,620
- What are you doing?
- Talking about the test.

712
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:13,704
Why?

713
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:16,415
You said you didn't want
to talk about Summer.

714
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:17,833
I don't.

715
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:20,460
Okay, so I moved to biology.

716
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:23,088
Sorry, did you want to talk about Spanish?

717
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,756
You just loved it, didn't you?

718
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,634
- Loved what?
- Seeing me nailed like that.

719
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:30,928
- It must have been a great moment.
- Not really.

720
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,556
You loved it, she loved it,
everybody loved it.

721
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,266
I did not love it.

722
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,316
- I really liked her, too.
- Yeah, I know.

723
00:40:47,986 --> 00:40:50,321
So where's your boyfriend tonight?

724
00:40:50,363 --> 00:40:53,365
He's not my boyfriend anymore.

725
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:56,827
- Why not?
- He didn't want to be.

726
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:00,413
Idiot.

727
00:41:01,832 --> 00:41:03,249
So is Summer.

728
00:41:05,418 --> 00:41:07,586
You think you'll get back together?

729
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,130
He was pretty set in his decision.

730
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,633
- When did it happen?
- Yesterday.

731
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:14,760
Wow.

732
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,553
It was our three-month anniversary.

733
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:21,016
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it does suck.

734
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:25,352
Do you think you guys will?

735
00:41:26,646 --> 00:41:28,939
- No.
- So, no?

736
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:31,650
No.

737
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:39,866
I'm sorry I gave you
such a hard time for a while.

738
00:41:40,075 --> 00:41:42,535
- That's okay.
- It is?

739
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:44,954
No, but you're sad.

740
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:49,750
I am sorry.

741
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:52,210
I accept your apology.

742
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,881
Man, it's a great party?

743
00:41:56,923 --> 00:41:58,424
Yeah, not bad.

744
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:02,261
It gave me a chance
to catch up on my reading.

745
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:06,681
You are very odd, you know that?

746
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,059
Thank you.

747
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:11,937
You're welcome.

748
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,203
I'm sorry. What did I do?
Did I bite your lip or something?

749
00:42:30,412 --> 00:42:33,581
No, it's not you. I just have to go.

750
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:44,216
- We have to go.
- Rory, are you okay?

751
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:46,718
- I have to go.
- Wait, can I get your number?

752
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,345
Last name's Kim.
We're the only ones in Stars Hollow.

753
00:42:49,429 --> 00:42:52,598
I can't believe I just gave my number
to a potential Korean doctor.

754
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,071
I'm ready to wallow now.

755
00:43:33,135 --> 00:43:36,930
Hey, Joe, it's Lorelai.
I need a pizza with everything, okay?

756
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,807
Thanks.
