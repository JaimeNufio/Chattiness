1
00:00:01,451 --> 00:00:04,516
Ribbons here! Return your ribbons here!

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:07,046
That's right, folks! Thank you, sir.

3
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:10,239
In the box, ma'am. Ribbons here, return your ribbons here!

4
00:00:10,316 --> 00:00:11,417
Kirk, stop that.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,249
Can't stop yet, Luke. Haven't got them all yet.

6
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:14,562
I mean it, put the box away.

7
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:16,584
Luke, you and Lorelai have reconciled.

8
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:17,726
I know, Kirk. I was there.

9
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:19,527
And since you two have reconciled,

10
00:00:19,606 --> 00:00:25,129
it's only appropriate that the citizens of Stars Hollow take off their pins and start to heal.

11
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,260
In my case, literally. I caught about an inch of chest-flesh with this sharp little sucker.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,910
- Kirk -
- Lulu! Hey!

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,070
No, Kirk! I like my ribbon! It's pink! I like pink!

14
00:00:36,157 --> 00:00:38,027
This is bigger than your love of pink!

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,041
No!

16
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:41,801
Lulu! Lulu, get back here!

17
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:42,921
Lulu!

18
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:45,989
Wow, did you see that?

19
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,534
You know, if someone opened a store in this town selling giant butterfly nets, they'd make a fortune.

20
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:52,220
Come on, the crazy need love too.

21
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,273
Speaking of which - Welcome back.

22
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:55,169
Nice to be here.

23
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:55,861
Want some coffee?

24
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:58,215
Oh, say that again, slower and with your pants off.

25
00:00:59,127 --> 00:00:59,732
What's that?

26
00:00:59,818 --> 00:01:00,781
My pretty, pretty face?

27
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:02,295
That's a Weston's coffee cup.

28
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:03,008
Is it?

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,650
You bring an enemy coffee cup in here on the day of our reconciliation.

30
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:08,707
At least I didn't ask you for a favor on this, the day of our daughter's wedding.

31
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:10,141
Get that coffee out of here.

32
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:11,409
This is not coffee.

33
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:14,748
This is a mocha chocolate caramel swirl-a-chino with extra whip cream.

34
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:15,818
That sounds disgusting.

35
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:20,274
It is. And if it was physically possible to make love to a hot beverage, this would be the one.

36
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,120
So apparently I've got competition.

37
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:23,533
No, no, no. It's just a fling.

38
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:27,334
I'll finally spend the night with it, but then when I see it in the morning with the caramel un-swirled

39
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:29,847
and the whip cream un-whipped, huh! Buh-bye.

40
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,606
Man, that was hard.

41
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:38,454
She must have stretched first.

42
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:40,923
So, judging from the snoring I'm guessing you love the theater.

43
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:42,490
That was not a snore. That was a groan.

44
00:02:42,558 --> 00:02:43,935
It was not a painful play.

45
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,696
Any play is a painful play for me.

46
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:48,660
Well, that's too bad, because you're going to miss out on some wonderful things.

47
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,889
Yeah, like what?

48
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:53,770
My mom took me to see Caroline, or Change in New York, Tony Kushner's musical,

49
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:57,816
and it was the most amazing thing we ever saw. Tony Kushner wrote Angels in America.

50
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:59,130
I know who Tony Kushner is.

51
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,077
So you've seen his plays?

52
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,434
No, my mom plays Canasta with him every month he's in town.

53
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:04,435
Tony Kushner plays Canasta with your mother?

54
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:05,531
Badly, but yes.

55
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,148
You have a magical life, Huntzberger! And you don't even know it.

56
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,100
So, where to next?

57
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:10,870
Oh, I don't know. Mah Jongg with Mamet?

58
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:11,722
How does ice cream sound?

59
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:12,545
Ice cream sounds great.

60
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:13,672
Then ice cream it is.

61
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:15,791
Whoa, Logan! Where are we going? Slow down.

62
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:16,887
Slow down and you die, Ace.

63
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,930
Yeah, you go too fast in heels and you kind of die also.

64
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:25,452
What are we doing?

65
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,823
We're getting ice cream.

66
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:30,250
But the dining hall's closed. We're breaking in.

67
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:31,960
That's a very negative way of looking at it.

68
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:34,044
How do you have a key to the dining hall?

69
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,273
I know a lot of very powerful locksmiths.

70
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,272
Well, what happens if we get caught? Could we get suspended?

71
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:40,831
They can't kick you out of school for this, can they?

72
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:42,835
Hey, relax. Look around.

73
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:44,955
For tonight this is all yours.

74
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,798
It is kind of cool.

75
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,853
Wait till you see the kitchen.

76
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:52,185
Whoa! Oh, I've never seen the cereal completely full before.

77
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,960
I'm never here early enough! I knew they had Cocoa Puffs.

78
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:56,189
Go crazy, Ace.

79
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:57,397
No, we're getting ice cream.

80
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,439
There's no rule that says you can't have ice cream and cereal. Go on, get your Cocoa Puffs.

81
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,606
First Cocoa Puffs of the day. This is a historic moment.

82
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:06,577
Okay. Next stop, ice cream.

83
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:08,221
What are you doing?

84
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:11,273
I'm looking for the swipe machine so I can deduct points from my meal plan.

85
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:12,224
You're kidding, right?

86
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:14,083
Well, the school pays for the food.

87
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,484
Trust me. With all the money my family has donated to this school,

88
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,649
they can afford to be out of a few Cocoa Puffs. Let's go.

89
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:19,581
This is fun.

90
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,482
You're an easy girl to please.

91
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,211
Let's hit the kitchen.

92
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:24,810
'Kay.

93
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:31,794
Ace, come on!

94
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,689
I'm coming!

95
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:37,491
Oh, okay, thanks. That's enough there. Just make sure you get the stairs now.

96
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:40,083
Oh, no, those go outside. Anacencia will take care of you.

97
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:41,623
Oh, what a surprise!

98
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,048
A plate of cookies on the coffee table to match the basket of cupcakes on the reception desk.

99
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:47,313
What? I always do this.

100
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:50,338
Oh, you always do this when a photographer from American Travel magazine

101
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,237
is coming to photograph us for -

102
00:04:52,315 --> 00:04:55,024
One of the Top Ten Inns in Connecticut!

103
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,952
I have no idea what you're talking about.

104
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:01,720
You know, I moved the furniture in the bedrooms around four times last night.

105
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:02,626
And you ended up?

106
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:04,920
With everything in exactly the same place I started with.

107
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,650
Oh, the dining room looks beautiful.

108
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:08,432
Thank you.

109
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,941
And, what a surprise, a cake on every table.

110
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:12,277
So no one has to share.

111
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,030
Okay, floor looks good, table looks good.

112
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,649
Hey, what happened to our books?

113
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:18,359
What do you mean?

114
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:20,158
All our beautiful, leather-bound books.

115
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:23,511
Jonathon Swift, Edith Wharton, Charles Dickens. A lot of them are gone.

116
00:05:23,582 --> 00:05:24,914
The guests must have swiped 'em.

117
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:28,795
They swiped Jonathon Swift and left me with Clifford, the Big Red Dog

118
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:31,324
and five copies of He's Just Not That Into You.

119
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:32,461
We've been airplane booked.

120
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:34,125
Oh, we've got to get them out of here.

121
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:35,348
Hey Eddie?

122
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:37,253
Will you get these out of here?

123
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,613
I'll raid Rory's leftovers tonight.

124
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,290
Well, there everybody is. Who missed Michel?

125
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:45,082
Huh. Trick question?

126
00:05:45,316 --> 00:05:46,543
How was California?

127
00:05:46,658 --> 00:05:49,485
Ah, you know, it is insanity.

128
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,563
What is different about me?

129
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:52,967
You're wearing sunglasses inside?

130
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,012
They're not sunglasses. They are eyewear.

131
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:58,194
Everyone in Los Angeles wears pairs and pairs of eyewear.

132
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,125
Well, you look great.

133
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:02,014
Oh, I tell you, I belong out there.

134
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:05,138
Everybody is thin and gorgeous.

135
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:09,049
Oh, there is this place on Sunset Boulevard, a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf,

136
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:12,274
and everybody there talks exactly like me.

137
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:12,910
Wow.

138
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:14,334
- I got Botox.
- Ow.

139
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:18,388
Dr. Wu, oh, she's a genius. Everyone goes there. And look.

140
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:22,468
I got them done by the same guy who does Nick Lachey.

141
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:24,793
Okay, gather around. I brought gifts.

142
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,745
Gifts, great!

143
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:29,555
Oh, the shopping out there, unbelievable.

144
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,500
Rodeo Drive, dig a hole and drop me in, even if I'm not dead yet.

145
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,200
Okay, for you and for you.

146
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,030
It's a smog globe. They are so funny in California.

147
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,053
Well, what do you know. He's Just Not That Into You.

148
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:50,808
I heard it's a fabulous book, and so true.

149
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:53,301
Oh, I haven't told you the most amazing part yet.

150
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:55,588
You got your boobs done by the same guy who did Pamela Anderson?

151
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:57,690
No, though I did meet him at the Coffee Bean.

152
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:01,580
I was at this place called the Farmer's Market, and I was just sitting there,

153
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:05,072
minding anybody's business, and a man came up to me

154
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,229
and asked if I would like to be a contestant on the Price is Right!

155
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,042
You're kidding!

156
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,935
I was so stunned!

157
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,985
I mean, I never considered being on a game show,

158
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:22,245
but I was finished with my Bubble Tea, so I figured, why not?

159
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,915
They just asked you to be on.

160
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:24,778
Yes.

161
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,263
Boy, that's weird. Jackson's cousin Monty did the Price is Right,

162
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,909
and he told us that the contestants had to get up at the crack of dawn,

163
00:07:29,977 --> 00:07:32,915
sit in line for hours, with hundreds of tourists,

164
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:35,629
and then show how enthusiastic of a contestant they would be.

165
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,005
You know, jumping up and down, screaming and yelling.

166
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:38,987
You don't say.

167
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,087
Yeah. And they had to wear embarrassing t-shirts that said things like 'Pick Me, Bob! I neutered my dog!'

168
00:07:44,148 --> 00:07:48,004
And they spent weeks studying the price of Turtle wax and Hamburger Helper.

169
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:52,085
Okay, fine! I may have jumped a little, but I did not wear a t-shirt.

170
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,399
Michel. What would Nick Lachey's teeth guy say?

171
00:07:54,471 --> 00:08:01,618
Make fun if you want, but I walked away the winner of over a hundred thousand dollar of cash and prizes!

172
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,088
Then what's with the cheap gifts?

173
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,920
That's not even that smoggy.

174
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:07,194
Why do I talk to you?

175
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:08,434
Why?

176
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:12,586
All right. I'm going to go run over to Luke's and grab some dinner, and then I will be back to finish the setup.

177
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:13,323
Got it.

178
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:24,004
Well, if you'd just put it in the box like I told you to, I wouldn't have had to follow you in.

179
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,533
- Here's your fries.
- Mm, good.

180
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,069
- Where's your burger?
- I ate it.

181
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,174
- I was gone two seconds.
- Ketchup, please?

182
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:31,182
By the time I get the ketchup, the fries'll be gone.

183
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,189
You're right, forget the ketchup.

184
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:33,239
Slow down!

185
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,682
I can't slow down. I only have fifteen minutes before I have to get back to the inn.

186
00:08:35,754 --> 00:08:37,008
You're going to make yourself sick.

187
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:40,157
Yes, but my sickness will remind me of you, so it'll be romantic.

188
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,248
Romantic nausea.

189
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:42,543
I get that all the time.

190
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,628
Hit me with the pie.

191
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,268
What pie?

192
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:45,261
The boysenberry pie.

193
00:08:45,343 --> 00:08:46,270
We're out of boysenberry pie.

194
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,853
How can you be out of boysenberry pie?

195
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:49,521
Because someone ordered the last piece.

196
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:52,286
But I specifically asked you to save me a piece of boysenberry pie.

197
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:53,453
Uh, no you didn't.

198
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:54,534
Uh, yes I did.

199
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:55,021
When?

200
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:56,307
I left you a message.

201
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:57,108
I never got a message.

202
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,517
I left it on your cell phone.

203
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:01,092
Oh, is that what that annoying beeping sound was?

204
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:04,569
Yes. It was telling you that your girlfriend called and asked you to save her some pie.

205
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,300
Well, I don't know how to use the voicemail.

206
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:07,119
You don't?

207
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:10,549
Or anything else on this stupid thing. I know how to make a call and answer a call and then I'm out.

208
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,176
Give me that. You have got to learn how to use this thing

209
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:18,522
because it is very powerful and wonderful, and it will change your life.

210
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:19,376
What are you doing?

211
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:25,879
I am putting my number on speed-dial, so all you have to do is press one, see,

212
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,083
like 'I'm number one' and then - oh, I wonder who that could be?

213
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:32,059
- Hello?
- Give me.

214
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:34,455
No cell phones in the diner.

215
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:36,149
- Oh, see, wasn't that fun?
- Totally.

216
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,706
Want me to put it on vibrate for you?

217
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:39,478
Fifteen minutes are up.

218
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:40,763
Oh, crap, I got to go.

219
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:41,699
Take a donut.

220
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:42,683
So then Sunday?

221
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:43,609
Pick you up at eight.

222
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:46,467
I'll leave you a message letting you know your chances of getting lucky.

223
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:48,729
Hey, Kirk, how's the ribbon collecting coming?

224
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:50,506
Oh, why do you get him started?

225
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:51,817
I think we're near the finish line.

226
00:09:51,893 --> 00:09:53,650
- Who's winning?
- Hey, this isn't a contest.

227
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,592
I just want to know.

228
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:55,651
I don't care who's winning.

229
00:09:55,723 --> 00:09:56,855
Well, then you won't care if it's me.

230
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:59,917
Well, of course it's you. You're the one who makes the costumes for the Christmas pageant.

231
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:03,377
You make the ornaments for the Firelight Festival. You go to the town meetings.

232
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:05,589
You say hello to people. You have a daughter that looks like

233
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,193
she belongs on top of a Christmas tree. Everybody knows that gets you tons of points.

234
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:09,782
Yeah.

235
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,207
There's no way to compete with that.

236
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:11,820
Kirk?

237
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:12,630
You're kicking his ass.

238
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:13,274
Yes!

239
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,407
This isn't a contest.

240
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:15,897
No, not now, it isn't.

241
00:10:15,973 --> 00:10:21,188
Kirk, I want a final tally, because the ribbon loser is buying the ribbon winner dinner Sunday night.

242
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,008
Loser pays? When did we agree on that?

243
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,711
Oh, gee, I must have left that on your voicemail too.

244
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:31,973
Hey Mom.

245
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:34,528
Hey. How would you feel about doing a little shopping tomorrow?

246
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,617
Hurt. Confused. A little dirty.

247
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,190
I need to get a new getting-back-together-with-Luke dress for my back-together-with-Luke date.

248
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:41,723
Oh, where do you want to go?

249
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:44,112
How about the new place where you got the scarf with the bows on it?

250
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:45,680
Oh, yes, cute place.

251
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:46,970
I want to go to the cute place.

252
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:47,736
Ten o'clock?

253
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:49,229
I'll be the one holding coffee.

254
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:50,969
So, uh, what are you doing tonight?

255
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:51,794
Mom.

256
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:54,071
What? Are you driving? Sounds like you're driving.

257
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,311
I am driving.

258
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:56,636
You are? Where are you going?

259
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:57,887
You know where I'm going, Mom.

260
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,008
- Disneyland?
- Nope.

261
00:10:59,079 --> 00:10:59,647
Puppy world?

262
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,829
You're so immature. You're going to make me say it?

263
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:02,592
Say what?

264
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,254
I am on my way to Friday night dinner.

265
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,294
Ah-ha-ha! That's right. You're on the road to Hellville.

266
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:10,160
Do not gloat.

267
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,248
I'm not gloating. I'm gloating with hand gestures.

268
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:12,862
Bye.

269
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,933
And a little soft shoe.

270
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:14,526
Got to go.

271
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:18,991
Listen, enjoy your glazed woodcock with a side of truffled goose head.

272
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,092
Oh, what a shame, I'm here.

273
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,442
- You are not.
- See you tomorrow.

274
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,789
Oh, Rory, wait. I'm gloating with jazz hands.

275
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:24,617
Bye, Mom.

276
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:28,990
Finish up, Kirk. I'm closing up early.

277
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,335
You're going to see Lorelai tonight, aren't you?

278
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:33,928
Actually no, she's working. I'm going to see her Sunday night.

279
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:35,253
That sounds nice.

280
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,548
You guys probably spend a lot of time together.

281
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:38,621
Yes, we do.

282
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:41,775
And you probably sleep over at each other's houses, too.

283
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,678
Cookies are on the house, Kirk. Just go, okay?

284
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,264
You know, Lulu's my first real girlfriend.

285
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:50,704
I had an imaginary girlfriend for a while when I was young, but she left me.

286
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:51,889
Well, that happens.

287
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,960
I wish Lulu and I could have what you and Lorelai have.

288
00:11:55,026 --> 00:11:59,034
Oh, you can have that, Kirk. You will have that. In fact, why don't you leave, and go have it right now?

289
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:00,442
You know, I live with my mother.

290
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,673
Apparently I'm officially in this conversation, don't know how it happened, but -

291
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,430
My mother is allergic to Lulu.

292
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:09,619
The minute Lulu comes in the room, my mother will cough and choke and turn red.

293
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,077
Her throat closes up, everything gets puffy.

294
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:17,027
Lulu's tried everything. She changed her soap, her perfume, shampoo, cream rinse, deodorant.

295
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:20,032
She's actually kind of a mess right now. But nothing seems to work.

296
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:20,483
Kirk -

297
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,109
Obviously I can't have Mother choking three times a week,

298
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:26,116
so I considered constructing a separate entrance to my room,

299
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,804
so that Lulu won't actually have to walk through the house,

300
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,573
but that's going to cost about forty thousand dollars,

301
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:33,325
'cause I'd have to break through a bearing wall, and -

302
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,828
Kirk, stop! This is ridiculous.

303
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,249
You're a grown man. You have got to change your living situation.

304
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:40,672
My mother won't move out. I've asked.

305
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,180
I'm not talking about your mother. I'm talking about you.

306
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,577
- Me?
- Yes, you.

307
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:47,260
Get a life. Get some independence. Get out of there.

308
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:47,650
But -

309
00:12:47,696 --> 00:12:49,805
You want to have a real relationship with Lulu?

310
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:50,527
Yes.

311
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,755
Then grow up. Be a man.

312
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:57,271
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying to me.

313
00:12:57,618 --> 00:13:02,207
Well, Kirk, I have given you the Lincoln logs, and you have to build the cabin.

314
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,158
Lock the door behind you.

315
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:11,832
You're not talking about a real cabin, are you?

316
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:15,862
'Cause if a new entrance is going to cost forty grand, then a cabin has got to be more.

317
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:16,819
Good night, Kirk!

318
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,233
Emily! They're here!

319
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,014
Hurry, please!

320
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:28,703
My goodness! The bag is bigger than you are.

321
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,909
I brought you some recent issues of the Yale Daily News.

322
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:32,798
We've been doing some really good articles lately.

323
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:36,004
And some with a by-line I might be familiar with, I hope?

324
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:39,193
I believe that, yes, you'll find some highlighted sections in your hymnals.

325
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,766
Then hand the bag over, my dear.

326
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,462
'Kay.

327
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:43,177
Sorry to keep everybody waiting.

328
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:46,382
Uh, luckily we had plenty to read.

329
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:47,452
Hello, Rory.

330
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:48,522
Hello, Grandma.

331
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:50,934
Let's go in the living room, shall we?

332
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:52,009
Excellent idea.

333
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:55,845
Pardon me, Mrs. Gilmore. Shall I put the salads out now, ma'am?

334
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:58,194
We haven't had drinks yet, Olympia.

335
00:13:58,266 --> 00:13:58,793
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:01,932
I wrote it all down on the refrigerator pad for you, Olympia.

337
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,345
Is someone else coming for dinner?

338
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:05,890
Someone else? No. It's just going to be us.

339
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:08,161
Us, meaning just the three of us here, right?

340
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,645
I mean, you know Mom's not coming.

341
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:13,350
Oh. Well, actually -

342
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:16,028
Of course we knew your mother's not coming. The maid made a mistake.

343
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,905
Olympia, it was three for dinner, not four.

344
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,830
Well, she's fired.

345
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,206
Clear that place at once, please.

346
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:26,432
Richard, take Rory in the living room. I'll just do it myself.

347
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:27,185
All right.

348
00:14:43,742 --> 00:14:47,464
Now, I had Olympia write out the reheating instructions for the goose.

349
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:50,126
And they work. I had her test it during dessert.

350
00:14:50,204 --> 00:14:51,085
Thank you, Grandma.

351
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,132
I also put some Perry and David fruit in there.

352
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:55,237
Oh, you can eat the pears with a spoon.

353
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:57,417
I'll remember that. Bye, Grandpa. Bye, Grandma.

354
00:14:57,566 --> 00:14:58,903
Bye, bye.

355
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:00,065
Bye, Rory.

356
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,438
Well, that was a pleasant evening.

357
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,410
Really? What dinner were you at?

358
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:08,160
Well, we weren't exactly sure she was coming, Emily.

359
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:09,373
I was sure.

360
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,934
I don't understand it. Why wasn't she here?

361
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,879
Well, I'm guessing she had something to do.

362
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:16,894
Something to do? What does that mean, something to do?

363
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,328
It means she had a previous engagement or meeting.

364
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:22,312
A dinner, perhaps.

365
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:24,795
I know what something to do means, Richard.

366
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,398
My apologies, Emily.

367
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,563
It doesn't make any sense at all.

368
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:33,356
I went down there. I arranged the whole thing. She got her filthy diner owner back.

369
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:35,629
- What is the problem?
- I don't know!

370
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,583
Lorelai is as much of a mystery to me as she is to you.

371
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,790
I made a whole goose for three people. Wasteful.

372
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,235
Do you think it's possible that they didn't get back together?

373
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:45,065
What?

374
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:46,268
Perhaps it didn't happen.

375
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,695
Maybe he didn't understand what you were telling him to do.

376
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:51,829
How could he not understand? I spelled it out for him, step by step.

377
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:56,370
I spoke clearly and slowly. There is no way he didn't understand what I was telling him to do.

378
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,749
All right. Then perhaps he understood, but he simply didn't do it?

379
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,446
He's not the most take-charge sort of fellow, you know.

380
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:06,724
He never did follow through on my advice to franchise his diner.

381
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,022
Oh, my God, you're right. He didn't do it.

382
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:11,571
He didn't go to her like I specifically told him to.

383
00:16:11,643 --> 00:16:12,637
So it would seem.

384
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,444
What an imbecile that man is!

385
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:16,938
Well, you gave it your best effort. No one can say you didn't.

386
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,823
I just don't believe it.

387
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,191
Don't worry, Emily.

388
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,342
I'm sure she'll come around eventually.

389
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,429
And then, at least, we won't have to deal with them as a couple.

390
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:27,735
Here, let me freshen up your drink.

391
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:37,874
If I still want that sweater in twenty minutes I'm coming back to get it.

392
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:40,869
Okay, wait. What is wrong with this picture?

393
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:45,263
You - look at you. An armful of bags and a potential twenty-minute sweater on the way,

394
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,787
and look at me. Completely bagless.

395
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:48,171
Relax, the day's still young.

396
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:51,432
There are no more clothes out there for me. The Lorelai look is over. I wish someone had told me.

397
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:52,466
That would've helped.

398
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:56,004
Oh, see? That's what I want. Hey, come on. Let's follow her.

399
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:57,483
I'm not following that girl.

400
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,864
But she knows where my stores are and she looks about my size,

401
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,069
so if she happens to have an aneurysm between now and tomorrow night - what?

402
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:06,018
My God. Is that Logan?

403
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,840
It is Logan. I can't believe it. What a jerk.

404
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:09,879
Mom, it's okay.

405
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:13,208
No, it's not okay! He's sitting over there with a girl and -

406
00:17:13,301 --> 00:17:14,851
oh, no you don't. Get me a rock.

407
00:17:14,938 --> 00:17:15,379
Mom -

408
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:16,827
I am beaning him with a rock!

409
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:18,451
Mom! Stop, it's fine!

410
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:21,067
How is it fine? I'm sorry, aren't you still seeing him?

411
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:21,876
Well, yeah.

412
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:25,352
Okay, so if you're still seeing him and he's over there seeing her,

413
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,837
how is that okay?

414
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:29,368
Because. We're keeping things casual.

415
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:30,247
Casual?

416
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:34,246
We see each other, we see other people, and that's him over there, seeing other people. So it's fine.

417
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,188
Oh.

418
00:17:35,296 --> 00:17:36,202
We both agreed.

419
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,433
Okay. You both agreed, then, okay.

420
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,346
But, aren't you guys sleeping together?

421
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,020
Mom. It's college.

422
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:45,495
Oh, right. It's college.

423
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:47,584
We're both busy. We have class, we have friends.

424
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:51,326
You know, it's good to just keep things cas, have fun. That's it.

425
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:55,387
Fun. Sure. I get it. Friends with benefits. No problem, I watch Oprah.

426
00:17:56,344 --> 00:17:59,754
Okay, so. Are you sure you're cool with this?

427
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,335
I'm completely cool with this.

428
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,343
'Kay. 'Cause it just really bothers -

429
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:07,015
Mom, look over there! I think the Lorelai look is back, and it's in velvet!

430
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:13,900
So, Hal, what do you think? Living room, reception area might be a nice place to start.

431
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:16,927
I really need to shoot the exteriors first. We're about to lose the light.

432
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:20,077
Oh, great idea. Well, let me tell you, we are very proud of our exteriors.

433
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:22,646
Why don't I get Michel to show you outside and help you set up?

434
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:23,332
Okay.

435
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:26,599
No, no. This is unacceptable. Put your supervisor on the phone now.

436
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:28,135
Now, right now!

437
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,234
Hey, everything okay, Michel?

438
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:32,343
Yes, everything is fine.

439
00:18:32,457 --> 00:18:34,929
Lots of sunshine. I'll be right with you.

440
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:39,214
I insist you do something about this before I go out and find a stick

441
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:43,330
and make it pointy and come and find your cubicle and poke you very hard!

442
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,876
Hey, tell you what. Why don't I just show you outside myself?

443
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:46,684
Okay.

444
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,339
Sure, I'll hold.

445
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,500
That's a look of great determination.

446
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,618
Yes, I'm determined to finish this piece before my caffeine buzz wears off

447
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,454
and I have about thirty seconds left.

448
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:07,555
So.

449
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,589
So.

450
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:11,895
Did I see you on State Street with...

451
00:19:11,962 --> 00:19:12,586
Yeah.

452
00:19:12,674 --> 00:19:16,002
Right. So you saw me on State Street with...

453
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:16,714
Yep.

454
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:18,812
So.

455
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:19,847
So.

456
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:21,608
Are we still good?

457
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:22,893
Absolutely.

458
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:24,619
Really?

459
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:27,102
Logan, we both agreed. No strings attached. Remember?

460
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,719
I remember. I was just checking to see how well you remember.

461
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,973
I remember perfectly.

462
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,600
Okay, that's good to hear. So -

463
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,443
Oh, we're not going to do the 'so' thing again, are we?

464
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,624
No, promise. No more so's. Would you take an 'um'?

465
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:38,826
Depends. Where's it leading?

466
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,706
Um, are you busy, or do you feel like grabbing a cup of coffee?

467
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:44,111
Why, do you have a master key to a Starbuck's or something?

468
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:45,759
Nah, just thought we'd walk in and pay.

469
00:19:45,842 --> 00:19:48,433
Wow. Old school. Sure, let's go.

470
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:50,229
Okay, let's go.

471
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,863
Yeah, there. Right there.

472
00:19:58,115 --> 00:19:59,077
How�s it looking, Hal?

473
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,603
I think we�re good with the flowers.

474
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:02,968
Let�s start clearing everyone out of there.

475
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:05,690
How�s it going?

476
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:07,664
I think we�re getting ready to shoot.

477
00:20:08,262 --> 00:20:09,046
What are you doing?

478
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,819
Well, just in case he doesn�t have time to do the shot of the kitchen, people will get to see the food.

479
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:14,366
You�re insane. Okay, we�re ready!

480
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:17,320
Okay, try something else! I don�t care, just stop it!

481
00:20:17,437 --> 00:20:20,137
Block it with your body! Tien an Men Square! Be a hero!

482
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:21,200
Uh, Michel, what�s wrong?

483
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:23,898
I will tell you what�s wrong. Ned the bellman is wrong.

484
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:27,719
He�s useless! I gave him specific instructions and he ignored them!

485
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,259
What the hell is that?

486
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,121
No, no, no! Do not drive that here!

487
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:35,685
It was not supposed to arrive for two more days.

488
00:20:35,806 --> 00:20:37,160
Seriously, what is that?

489
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:40,395
My �over one hundred thousand dollar in cash and prizes�.

490
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,343
That�s what you won?

491
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:44,194
That, and many boxes of some sort of instant rice dish

492
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:46,217
that I have yet to feel the need to sample.

493
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:50,611
Are you Michel Girard?

494
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:51,250
Yes.

495
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:54,184
Well, Michel Gerard, I am pleased to present you with your motor home.

496
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,452
Step on inside and I�ll show you how everything works.

497
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:58,572
I don�t want to know how it works. I don�t want it here at all.

498
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:00,313
Michel, I don�t understand.

499
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:04,731
After I won this monstrosity, I told them I did not want it. I wanted the cash.

500
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,439
But they said they would only give me half of what it was worth!

501
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:11,700
Yeah! Jackson�s cousin won a washer and dryer on the twenty five thousand dollar Pyramid,

502
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,622
but he decided to take half the cash value �cause he likes to go to the Laundromat to pick up women.

503
00:21:15,678 --> 00:21:19,293
Well, I am not Jackson�s cousin. I have all of my chromosomes, and I don�t want half of the cash value.

504
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,988
I want the entire hundred thousand dollars that was flashing under my face.

505
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:25,186
Excuse me. Do you want to know how to use it or not?

506
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:27,121
�Cause the leveling can be a little tricky.

507
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,825
No, I do not want to know how to use it!

508
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:30,500
Okay. Enjoy your day.

509
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:32,523
Drop dead and we�ll discuss it.

510
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:34,751
They told me I had a week before they were delivering it.

511
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:36,936
I put an ad online and I was going to sell it.

512
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:39,660
And then I get a call that it is coming and it has not been a week!

513
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:44,069
Oh, wait, sir? Could I, uh, pay you to just take this away for an hour?

514
00:21:44,131 --> 00:21:45,943
You know, drive it around, show it the sights?

515
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:48,395
Sorry. Once we deliver the keys, it�s out of our hands.

516
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,316
Uh, Lorelai?

517
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:51,294
Taking care of it, Hal.

518
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:54,599
By the time all this dust clears, I�m afraid we�ll have lost the light anyway.

519
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:57,657
No, no, we�re not losing the light. We�ll keep the light, lose the dust.

520
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,844
Sookie, get the dust busters? Michel, move this thing.

521
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,889
Squawk at the roast?

522
00:22:02,961 --> 00:22:03,735
Michel!

523
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:05,214
I don�t know how it works!

524
00:22:05,301 --> 00:22:05,931
Figure it out!

525
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,297
You figure it out! It�s like the space shuttle in here.

526
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:09,607
Okay. We�re done here.

527
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:10,355
What? No!

528
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:11,573
It�s too late.

529
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:14,215
I can take some interior shots just for the hell of it.

530
00:22:14,302 --> 00:22:16,131
Oh, sure. Sookie, why don�t you show him the kitchen?

531
00:22:16,217 --> 00:22:18,050
Really? Great. Follow me.

532
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:23,037
You know, I can�t believe it.

533
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:27,303
I can�t believe you had your motor home delivered here, to the inn, today!

534
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:29,007
I was supposed to have a week!

535
00:22:29,094 --> 00:22:32,130
You know, Michel, I know the world revolves around you and we all have to understand that,

536
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:32,806
but this was important.

537
00:22:32,904 --> 00:22:34,603
I didn�t think it was coming today.

538
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:38,413
You didn�t think, period. You know, I don�t always expect you to be a great help around here,

539
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:42,226
but how about not being a super colossal hindrance to us all, okay!

540
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,225
Business or pleasure?

541
00:22:56,298 --> 00:22:58,627
Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy:

542
00:22:58,704 --> 00:23:00,957
Lord and peasant and the making of the modern world.

543
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,754
Oh. Pleasure.

544
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:03,758
Have you read it?

545
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:05,294
I�m waiting for the film to come out.

546
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:08,615
Yeah, I heard Renee Zellweger is gaining a ton of weight to play the peasant.

547
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:11,499
Listen, I was wondering if you�re doing anything tomorrow night.

548
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,830
Oh. Um, I don�t know. Why?

549
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:15,831
Well, it�s Finn�s birthday. He�s having a party.

550
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:17,664
Lots of booze, no food whatsoever.

551
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,564
Ah, that Finn.

552
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,952
I was wondering if you�d like to go.

553
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:21,463
With you?

554
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:22,578
Well, that was the plan, yes.

555
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:26,644
Oh. Well, um, sure.

556
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:27,146
Yes?

557
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,568
Yes. I�d love to.

558
00:23:28,662 --> 00:23:30,520
Um, let�s celebrate another year of Finn.

559
00:23:30,582 --> 00:23:34,222
Excellent. Now, it�s themed. Anything Quentin Tarantino is acceptable,

560
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,864
and I�ll pick you up at your room around nine.

561
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:36,530
Sounds good.

562
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:37,243
Does it?

563
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:38,672
Well, how about that.

564
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:53,498
Hey, Sookie, have you seen Michel? He was arranging a car to take the Martins to Foxwoods.

565
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:55,127
I think he�s showing some people the motor home.

566
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:56,008
Now?

567
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,732
He asked me if it was okay. I told him it was okay. Is it okay?

568
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:00,932
Yeah, it�s okay, but why didn�t he just ask me?

569
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:02,249
I think he�s a little afraid of you.

570
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:03,667
Afraid of me? Of kitten?

571
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:05,208
Was I really that mean?

572
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:06,295
You were upset.

573
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:07,235
I was mean.

574
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,615
You know Michel. He likes to dish it out, but he�s extremely sensitive if you give it back.

575
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:11,501
Yeah. I guess.

576
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:14,409
You can�t even tease him. He never wore those red cowboy boots again.

577
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:15,592
I remember.

578
00:24:15,797 --> 00:24:17,630
I�m sure he�ll get over it. You know Michel.

579
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,315
Yeah.

580
00:24:18,402 --> 00:24:20,548
Hey, could you ask Eddie to get the Martins a car?

581
00:24:21,404 --> 00:24:22,427
You got it.

582
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,935
What�s the gas mileage like?

583
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:26,591
The gas mileage?

584
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,092
It�s five thousand pounds of metal on wheels. I�m sure the mileage is fabulous.

585
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:31,218
Would you take twenty for it?

586
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,712
Twenty? But it�s brand new, and �

587
00:24:33,824 --> 00:24:37,111
oh, whatever. Twenty, sure. You got a cheque?

588
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:43,414
Oh, whoa, whoa! Hi. What Michel means to say is that he would happily entertain all offers

589
00:24:43,503 --> 00:24:47,510
for this top-of-the-line streamlined beautiful motor home.

590
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,768
I mean, look at it! I just may buy it myself.

591
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:50,688
What are you talking about?

592
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:51,938
Offer thirty.

593
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:54,815
Hey, has everyone seen inside this baby?

594
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:58,379
�Cause if you haven�t, you need to. Seriously.

595
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:07,627
And while you�re taking a look, please note the plush soil and stain resistant wall-to-wall wallpaper,

596
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:12,643
that acts as the beautiful maple-ish paneling. Huh? Yeah.

597
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:16,797
Twenty grand? You�re just giving this thing away.

598
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:17,949
That�s what I was told to do.

599
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,839
I didn�t know about the maple-ish paneling.

600
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:24,303
Michel, you can�t sell this thing for twenty thousand dollars. What are you thinking?

601
00:25:24,386 --> 00:25:26,443
Apparently I�m not. Apparently I never think.

602
00:25:26,704 --> 00:25:28,261
Okay, okay. I�m sorry.

603
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:29,028
Whatever.

604
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:34,614
Michel, I was just tense about the photo shoot and I said things I shouldn�t have said.

605
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:35,972
You know I didn�t mean them, right?

606
00:25:36,028 --> 00:25:37,195
I do not know that at all.

607
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:41,337
I think you do. I think you know this inn could not run without you.

608
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,137
And I think you know I know this inn could not run without you.

609
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,107
What about your photo shoot? I ruined it for you, no?

610
00:25:47,194 --> 00:25:48,940
We rescheduled the photo shoot. Everything�s fine.

611
00:25:49,017 --> 00:25:52,063
I could have told you they�d reschedule. Everything with you is so dramatic.

612
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,523
So what are we going to do here?

613
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:56,540
Oh, well, I just want the thing gone.

614
00:25:56,737 --> 00:26:00,989
Michel, you had one hundred thousand dollars flash in front of your face

615
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:04,137
and the entire world saw it. Now come on, go get your money.

616
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:04,844
Well �

617
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:09,492
Seriously, Michel, the rube with the crossed eyes and the bolo tie, I say that�s your man.

618
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,772
He does look stupid, doesn�t he?

619
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:16,783
Yeah. And familiar with the, uh, ways of hooking up things to local sewer lines. Huh? Go get �em!

620
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:18,401
Yes, I�ll zero in on him.

621
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:21,837
Worse comes to worst, the woman with the elastic waist jeans should be a nice backup.

622
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:22,441
Attaboy.

623
00:26:22,518 --> 00:26:25,237
You know, if I hold out, maybe I can get a hundred and twenty thousand instead of �

624
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:26,547
- Just sell the thing!
- Right.

625
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:41,027
Well?

626
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:42,066
It�s too sparkly.

627
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,433
It�s not too sparkly.

628
00:26:43,511 --> 00:26:44,734
I look like a chandelier.

629
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:45,830
What shoes are you wearing?

630
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:46,803
The pink pumps.

631
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:47,662
I like those.

632
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,957
Are they a little too �Come and get it�?

633
00:26:49,045 --> 00:26:50,033
Don�t you want him to come and get it?

634
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:52,403
Uh, yes, but I want it to be his idea to come and get it.

635
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:54,452
It�s not the same if the shoes tell him to �Come and get it�.

636
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:56,336
I really, really want to stop saying �Come and get it�.

637
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,124
Fine.

638
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,005
I have to get ready.

639
00:26:58,123 --> 00:26:58,727
Going out?

640
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:00,719
As a matter of fact, I have a date tonight.

641
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:01,471
Logan?

642
00:27:01,737 --> 00:27:03,011
No, Robert.

643
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:03,883
Who�s Robert?

644
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:04,714
He�s a friend.

645
00:27:04,788 --> 00:27:06,126
Have I met this Robert?

646
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:07,444
No, you have not met this Robert.

647
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,409
What�s his last name?

648
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,944
Why? Do you think I�m making him up?

649
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:11,885
I just wondered if I ever heard you mention him before.

650
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:16,079
Um, he�s just a guy I know at Yale, and there�s a party tonight for another guy I know at Yale,

651
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:21,070
and Robert Grimmaldi asked me to go, so I am going to go.

652
00:27:21,147 --> 00:27:23,283
So, does this mean it�s over with Logan?

653
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,981
Nope. It just means that tonight I�m going out with Robert.

654
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,156
And you like this Robert, right?

655
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:31,828
Right. You know. The party�s a Quentin Tarantino themed party,

656
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:33,818
and you have to wear a costume, so I�m going as Gogo.

657
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:34,746
�Cause you have the skirt.

658
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:35,786
And no other ideas.

659
00:27:35,873 --> 00:27:37,818
Cluelessness is the mother of invention. Call me after.

660
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,592
I will do that.

661
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:40,486
Oh, this dress is too slutty.

662
00:27:40,573 --> 00:27:42,959
The dress is fine. The person in it, however �

663
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:47,239
You�re breaking up, the, the house is going through a tunnel. You�re breaking up, I �

664
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:57,962
Oh, I was just gonna �

665
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,479
I just heard the car, so I �

666
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:01,595
No, but I always �

667
00:28:01,678 --> 00:28:03,014
I know. Yeah, I know.

668
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:03,905
No, I should�ve.

669
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:07,402
�Kay, this is stupid.

670
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:08,277
Yes, it is.

671
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,536
It�s not like we�ve never done this before.

672
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:11,053
We have.

673
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:11,754
And successfully.

674
00:28:11,836 --> 00:28:12,563
I�ve made it to the door.

675
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:13,520
I�ve made it to the car.

676
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:17,948
Hey.

677
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:19,071
Hey.

678
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:26,919
So I thought we�d go to Marino�s. You like Marino�s, right?

679
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:27,667
Mmm.

680
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:33,795
- What is this?
- What?

681
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:35,092
- Reggae Fever?
- So?

682
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,625
When did you buy this? Where did you buy this?

683
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,803
Why did you buy this?

684
00:28:38,862 --> 00:28:41,844
I was at the gas station last week. It was at the register. What�s the big deal?

685
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:44,578
The big deal is it�s Reggae Fever.

686
00:28:44,651 --> 00:28:45,152
I know!

687
00:28:45,234 --> 00:28:47,266
When you look in the mirror, do you see Reggae Fever?

688
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,193
It was cheap.

689
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:51,347
�Ja Glory� by Toots Bambada.

690
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,030
�Lively up Yourself� by the Family Zigzag,

691
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:56,514
�Let your Ya be Ya� by Ranking Roy.

692
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:59,494
What else am I going to find in here? Ganja and a yellow, green and red knit cap?

693
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,511
I bought a C.D. I didn�t adopt the entire Rastafarian culture.

694
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:08,408
This is so weird. I mean, to think that there was this whole chunk of time when we weren�t together.

695
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:10,737
We were living totally separate lives.

696
00:29:10,942 --> 00:29:16,274
I was just working like crazy and you were running around, buying reggae C.D.�s.

697
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:17,747
One C.D. One.

698
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,488
I just hate that we were apart.

699
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:24,285
Yeah, wasn�t too fond of it myself.

700
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:30,485
Well, all I can say is, you�re lucky I�m back in your life, because clearly you were lost without me.

701
00:29:30,557 --> 00:29:32,866
I mean, it�s a miracle you�re even still alive.

702
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:35,217
Right?

703
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:36,876
You bet.

704
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:47,658
Not a moment too soon.

705
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:52,118
Oh, no thanks. I think I�m going to try to get through the doorway first.

706
00:29:52,194 --> 00:29:54,837
Huh, novel approach. You�re going to be an interesting date.

707
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:56,464
Robert! What are you?

708
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:57,575
Dead extra number two.

709
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:58,697
Brilliant, my friend.

710
00:29:58,795 --> 00:30:00,974
Happy birthday, Finn. You owe me forty dollars.

711
00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:03,039
Well, maybe for my birthday you�ll forgive me that.

712
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:07,683
Does your father have any idea what a toll his cross-dressing took on your psyche?

713
00:30:07,763 --> 00:30:08,819
That was your father, Finn.

714
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:11,261
Ah, you�re right. My God, that explains a lot.

715
00:30:11,631 --> 00:30:13,484
- Do I know you?
- Rory Gilmore, Finn.

716
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:18,522
Pleasure to meet you. All right, children, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we will all be in a great deal of pain.

717
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:22,464
Thank you, darling. Your name and phone number would also be appreciated.

718
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:25,594
Finn�s quite an original.

719
00:30:25,684 --> 00:30:28,056
Yes, he is. Have I told you I like your costume?

720
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:28,987
No, you didn�t.

721
00:30:29,086 --> 00:30:31,266
All right. Did that count, or are you expecting me to say it again?

722
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:32,460
I think we�re good.

723
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:33,699
Let�s get a drink.

724
00:30:36,005 --> 00:30:37,625
Oh, hey, Colin. Where�s your date?

725
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:40,584
I went to go pick her up. She�s dressed like Mira Sorvino.

726
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:41,988
How do you dress like Mira Sorvino?

727
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,476
You have blonde hair and a name tag that says �Mira Sorvino�.

728
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:45,868
I just turned around and left.

729
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:49,308
Well, well, well. The gang�s all here. Robert, good to see you.

730
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:49,975
Hello, Logan.

731
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:50,968
Rory, like the costume.

732
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,904
I like yours too.

733
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:53,963
This is Whitney. Whitney, Robert, Rory. You know Colin.

734
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:54,829
Hi.

735
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,903
Whitney, is your friend Josie here?

736
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,167
Yeah, she�s over there with the guy dressed like Harvey Weinstein.

737
00:30:58,238 --> 00:30:59,416
Perfect. I�ll see you later.

738
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:00,387
Leave her alone, Colin.

739
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,037
Yes, yes. Of course.

740
00:31:02,436 --> 00:31:03,972
So. Good party, huh?

741
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:04,843
Seems like it.

742
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:05,801
Music�s cool.

743
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:08,381
Very cool. Well, we�re just heading over to the bar, can we get you two anything?

744
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:09,896
No, we�re just going to take a look around.

745
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:11,012
Okay, well, catch you later.

746
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:11,925
Sounds good.

747
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:14,054
Hey, Robert.

748
00:31:14,135 --> 00:31:14,653
Yes.

749
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,586
What�s your last name?

750
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,082
My God, turn that off!

751
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:21,012
Getting to you, huh?

752
00:31:21,192 --> 00:31:23,731
You keep playing the same song over and over and over.

753
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,863
I�ve got news for you. That was not the same song.

754
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:29,133
Oh my God, you�re kidding.

755
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:30,669
What was that?

756
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,186
I don�t know.

757
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:32,568
Sounds like it came from the garage.

758
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:33,883
There�s someone in my garage?

759
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:37,734
Huh. Weird time for gardening, isn�t it?

760
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,054
It could be like a raccoon.

761
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:41,011
Oh, hey, don�t shovel the raccoon.

762
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:42,292
Just stay back, will you?

763
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:45,118
No, Luke! You can�t hurt a raccoon. They�re cute.

764
00:31:45,215 --> 00:31:47,346
They have face masks like little furry burglars.

765
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:50,413
And sharp teeth that chew through your wiring, and rabies �

766
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:50,827
Luke.

767
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:52,122
I�m not going to hit it, I�m going to scare it.

768
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:54,236
Hey! Why don�t you play it your Reggae Fever.

769
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:00,917
- Do you see it?
- Shh!

770
00:32:04,206 --> 00:32:05,434
That�s one hell of a raccoon.

771
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,205
Shovel him. Shovel him! Shovel him!

772
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,092
I probably should be more surprised than I am, right?

773
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,511
Kirk! Wake up.

774
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:16,298
And he�s naked.

775
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:17,619
Oh, Kirk! Geez!

776
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:18,526
Where am I?

777
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:19,426
You�re in my house, Kirk.

778
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:20,359
You�re in my boat, Kirk.

779
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:21,153
I�m exposed.

780
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:21,859
We know, Kirk.

781
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:23,579
Yeah, let�s do something about that, huh, Kirk?

782
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:25,085
I�m good now.

783
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:26,846
Kirk.

784
00:32:27,772 --> 00:32:29,021
Whatcha doin� here?

785
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:30,142
I left Mother�s.

786
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:32,960
No, did you have a fight? Did she take away your Beach Boys album again?

787
00:32:33,016 --> 00:32:36,492
No, I just got so excited about the thought of a new life, you know?

788
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,165
Of striking out on my own and being my own man.

789
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:40,000
Right, Luke?

790
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:41,904
Right, Luke?

791
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,331
So I did it. I packed my clothes

792
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:47,367
and I gave my mother my key and I said good bye and I left.

793
00:32:47,454 --> 00:32:50,428
Aw, Kirk. That�s a big deal, you leaving like that.

794
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,417
I know it is.

795
00:32:51,564 --> 00:32:55,606
But Luke explained to me that if I really want to move to the next level with Lulu

796
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:58,949
and have a real, grownup relationship, with sleepovers and everything,

797
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:00,291
then I had to get out.

798
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:03,045
I don�t think that�s exactly what I said.

799
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:08,594
Oh, yes, it was. And I felt really good about it, until I realized that I had no place to go.

800
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:10,541
I probably should have found an apartment first.

801
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:11,391
Probably.

802
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:12,798
You can stay in Rory�s room.

803
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:13,896
- Really?
- Really?

804
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,322
Just for tonight. We�ll find you some place tomorrow.

805
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:17,238
Okay.

806
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,437
You know, I think you�ve got a raccoon in here.

807
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:24,676
Just go on in the house, Kirk.

808
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:27,130
What were you thinking?

809
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:32,236
Kirk was at the diner talking about how he wished how he and Lulu had what we have, and I just mentioned �

810
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:35,327
Are you insane? Everybody knows you can�t mention anything to Kirk.

811
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:37,355
I was cornered. I was tired. I wanted to go to sleep.

812
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:41,133
Well, now we have to go in there and take care of him. He is now our responsibility.

813
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:41,711
But �

814
00:33:41,793 --> 00:33:43,733
Uh, uh! Pottery Barn, baby. You break it, you buy it.

815
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:45,182
Ah, geez.

816
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:02,007
My entire goal in life is to outlive my brother, inherit the family fortune,

817
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:04,962
put all my sisters out on the street and live as frivolously as possible,

818
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:07,316
have numerous wives, thousands of illegitimate children

819
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:10,451
and die completely alone and leave every cent to a parrot named Polly.

820
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,437
That�s your entire goal in life.

821
00:34:12,513 --> 00:34:15,130
Except for the name of the parrot, I stick to everything I just said.

822
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:17,091
You�re a fascinating specimen, Robert.

823
00:34:17,204 --> 00:34:18,376
Well, Josie�s a lesbian.

824
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:19,507
You struck out, Colin?

825
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:21,074
Whatever. Is Lydia here?

826
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,965
Yeah, she�s here with Patrick, her fianc�.

827
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:26,517
God, I hate these stupid incestuous parties! It�s the same people over and over.

828
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:27,750
Who�s as drunk as I am?

829
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:31,350
No one since Spencer Tracy died. Finn, are there any interesting women here at all?

830
00:34:31,423 --> 00:34:32,451
Have you tried Josie?

831
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:33,660
I�m getting a drink.

832
00:34:33,926 --> 00:34:36,251
All righty. I have to go make the rounds.

833
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:38,268
Have I met you yet?

834
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,211
Several times.

835
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:40,101
All right then.

836
00:34:41,254 --> 00:34:42,799
So, how about that drink?

837
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:43,818
Nothing too strong?

838
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:44,776
I�ll see what I can do.

839
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:50,197
Hey, Ace. Having a good time?

840
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,478
I am, thanks.

841
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,798
Good. That�s good. Me, too. I�m having a good time too.

842
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:54,919
Good.

843
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:56,269
Yes, it is good.

844
00:34:57,426 --> 00:34:58,912
So I didn�t know you knew Robert.

845
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:01,923
I met him at the Life and Death Brigade gathering. And the poker game.

846
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:04,361
Oh. Right, right. Well, he must have made quite an impression.

847
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:06,275
- He just asked me out, is all.
- Sure.

848
00:35:07,796 --> 00:35:09,455
- He�s kind of a jerk.
- Excuse me?

849
00:35:09,526 --> 00:35:11,842
Robert. He�s kind of a jerk. Haven�t you noticed he�s kind of a jerk?

850
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:12,459
Nope.

851
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:13,576
Huh.

852
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,155
Night�s young. Okay, come on.

853
00:35:17,303 --> 00:35:18,551
Where are we going? Logan!

854
00:35:19,945 --> 00:35:20,775
You look great.

855
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,690
Thank you.

856
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:26,239
Logan, stop.

857
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,359
Right, so, how you been?

858
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:28,659
I�ve been fine.

859
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:29,760
Good. School�s good?

860
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:30,686
School�s hard.

861
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:32,141
Well, it�s supposed to be hard.

862
00:35:32,326 --> 00:35:33,462
It�s grounding you for life.

863
00:35:35,454 --> 00:35:37,097
Making you an upstanding citizen.

864
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:40,406
God-fearing Christian.

865
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:41,485
Habitual recycler.

866
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,267
We can�t do this here, Logan.

867
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,148
You�re right. Let�s go.

868
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:47,762
Go where?

869
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,153
Your place. My place. Let�s take a train to New York, spend the night in the Plaza.

870
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:51,908
We can�t just leave. We have dates.

871
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:54,393
I don�t like this.

872
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:55,253
Like what?

873
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,036
You here with Robert.

874
00:35:56,108 --> 00:35:56,978
You�re here with Whitney.

875
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:57,747
I know!

876
00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:59,195
So, what�s the problem?

877
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:01,874
The problem is you�re here with Robert and it�s bothering me, and I don�t like that it�s bothering me.

878
00:36:01,935 --> 00:36:03,153
Sorry. Do you want us to leave?

879
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:05,253
No, I want us to leave. You and me.

880
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:06,153
I can�t do that.

881
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:08,187
Oh, you want to spend the rest of the night with Robert instead of me?

882
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:09,179
I came here with Robert.

883
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:10,501
So dump Robert! I hate Robert!

884
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:11,536
He�s your friend!

885
00:36:11,621 --> 00:36:12,835
So what? I still hate him.

886
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,791
Logan, you�re the one who said �

887
00:36:14,858 --> 00:36:15,703
I know what I said.

888
00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:19,779
Okay, then. I have to go. I have a date. Enjoy the rest of the party.

889
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:41,610
There�s nothing in here but ice cream, candy bars, cookie dough, canned frosting.

890
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,565
Why are you not four hundred and fifty pounds?

891
00:36:43,641 --> 00:36:45,848
I know. Scientists call it the Lorelai Paradox.

892
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:47,043
Who are you calling?

893
00:36:47,098 --> 00:36:49,321
No one. Just seeing if Rory left a message.

894
00:36:50,006 --> 00:36:51,173
Who�s washing those?

895
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:55,438
Why, was she supposed to leave a message?

896
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,225
No, I was just hoping.

897
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,378
Are we out of plastic?

898
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,798
Why were you hoping? Everything okay with her?

899
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,458
Yeah, she just had a date tonight. Get four, those tend to break.

900
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:05,250
Okay.

901
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:08,894
Uh, she out with that Logan kid?

902
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:09,873
No. Robert.

903
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:11,147
Who�s Robert?

904
00:37:11,234 --> 00:37:13,436
I know nothing about him except his last name is Grimmaldi.

905
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:15,152
When did she break up with Logan?

906
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:15,905
She didn�t.

907
00:37:16,472 --> 00:37:17,318
I don�t understand.

908
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,176
It�s college.

909
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,063
What does that mean?

910
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,455
It means, butt out, back off, none of your business.

911
00:37:21,701 --> 00:37:23,999
Rory suddenly decided she�s dating girl.

912
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,933
Well, that�s okay, right? Isn�t that what kids are supposed to do?

913
00:37:26,005 --> 00:37:28,310
It�s just, it�s not Rory.

914
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,683
I don�t think it�s what is going to make her happy. It seems wrong for her.

915
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:32,518
You say something to her?

916
00:37:32,611 --> 00:37:37,408
No. I mean, she�s been so chatty lately, wanting to be able to talk about Logan and her life,

917
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:39,584
so now I just don�t know what to do.

918
00:37:39,661 --> 00:37:40,522
You talk back.

919
00:37:40,608 --> 00:37:42,836
I am, but I just feel like I need to be really careful what I say.

920
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:44,012
Oh, come on. That�s ridiculous.

921
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:46,255
Well, she�s not at home anymore. She� s on her own.

922
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:47,909
- Doesn�t matter.
- It matters a little.

923
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:51,473
You know, there have been very few times in our relationship when I ever played the �mom card�.

924
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,819
But I always had it there in my back pocket.

925
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:56,920
And when I used it she had to hear it and take it, �cause she lived here.

926
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:59,461
And even if she didn�t like it or even if she got mad,

927
00:37:59,563 --> 00:38:03,131
the worst that would happen is she would run into her room and slam the door and blast the Jam.

928
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:07,160
But then in the morning, I controlled the bathroom, and the, and the Pop-tarts,

929
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:11,343
and she had to deal with me. And eventually we�d make up and it was over. But now �

930
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,413
Nothing�s different.

931
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:13,704
Of course it�s different.

932
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:16,587
She�s on her own. She�s making her own decisions.

933
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:21,820
My �mom card� is looking a little flimsier, and I don�t know how much to say to her.

934
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:24,354
If she doesn�t want to hear it, she doesn�t have to take it.

935
00:38:24,457 --> 00:38:26,710
She doesn�t have to call, or come home.

936
00:38:26,797 --> 00:38:28,511
She�ll call. She�ll come home.

937
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:31,199
Yeah. I hope so. I don�t know.

938
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:37,528
Did we lock the front door?

939
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:38,747
I�ll be right back.

940
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:43,979
Kirk!

941
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:45,650
Get back here, Kirk!

942
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:53,738
What on earth is wrong with you, besides the obvious lack of fashion sense?

943
00:38:53,856 --> 00:38:54,245
What are you �

944
00:38:54,321 --> 00:38:56,171
I told you to get back together with Lorelai!

945
00:38:56,257 --> 00:38:59,682
I told you exactly what to do and exactly what to say. What do you need, a cheat sheet?

946
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:00,471
Emily �

947
00:39:00,558 --> 00:39:03,852
Some flash cards, some Sesame Street characters to sing a song about it?

948
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:04,455
Look!

949
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:08,002
Do you think that it was easy for me to come to you like that? Do you think I enjoyed it?

950
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:10,889
Like I was just sitting around my house thinking, hmm, what shall I do tonight?

951
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:15,241
I know. I can drive to Stars Hollow and humiliate myself at the local greasy spoon!

952
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:16,487
Okay, I am in the middle of �

953
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:18,203
I don�t care what you�re in the middle of!

954
00:39:18,294 --> 00:39:22,758
My family is being torn apart because for some reason you are incapable of taking simple instructions

955
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,815
and putting your relationship back together!

956
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:28,662
Hello?

957
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,540
Just because you run a diner and have mastered the art of the blank stare

958
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:33,296
does not mean it�s going to work with me!

959
00:39:34,232 --> 00:39:36,905
And Richard went through a great deal of trouble to set the whole thing up,

960
00:39:36,966 --> 00:39:40,408
and you never even called Herb Smith! Apparently, you can�t follow through with anything!

961
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:41,826
Not even a razor!

962
00:39:41,897 --> 00:39:43,075
Mom, what are you doing here?

963
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,421
I am having what I�m sure will turn out to be yet another fruitless conversation with this man.

964
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:48,999
I�m sorry. I�m really, really sorry.

965
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:49,510
It�s okay.

966
00:39:49,592 --> 00:39:52,168
Mom, go home. You have no right to barge in here and cause a scene.

967
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:53,607
I have something I want to say.

968
00:39:53,678 --> 00:39:55,486
No! We don�t want to hear what you have to say!

969
00:39:55,568 --> 00:39:57,826
We just want you to please butt out of our lives!

970
00:39:57,898 --> 00:39:58,762
Our lives?

971
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:01,323
So there�s an �our lives�? Are you two back together?

972
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,393
Yes, we are.

973
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,518
So you did go to her. Just like I told you to.

974
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:07,124
We got back together because we wanted to get back together.

975
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,673
Then I simply don�t understand. If you�re together, then what�s the problem?

976
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:10,836
What are you talking about?

977
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:12,550
Why won�t you come to Friday dinner?

978
00:40:12,637 --> 00:40:15,442
Whatever happened between the two of you, I obviously fixed it, so �

979
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:17,042
You fixed it? You broke it!

980
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:21,056
Just because Luke and I found a way to repair the damage doesn�t erase the fact that it happened!

981
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:22,826
What I did I did out of concern.

982
00:40:22,893 --> 00:40:23,636
Oh, please!

983
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:25,837
As your mother, I have the right to be concerned.

984
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,345
Especially when it looks like you�re taking your life down a completely disastrous path.

985
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,629
I had to jump in, and �

986
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:31,310
Mom!

987
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:31,916
Lorelai!

988
00:40:31,998 --> 00:40:36,205
Please hear me. If I want your input in my life in any way, shape or form, I will ask for it.

989
00:40:36,277 --> 00:40:38,700
Until then, do us all a favor and shut up!

990
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:50,382
Well, I gotta say, suddenly a big fan of speed-dial.

991
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,853
Hey, kid, what�s going on?

992
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,889
I just got a call from Kirk. He wanted to know if he could crash at my dorm.

993
00:41:03,976 --> 00:41:04,894
Ho, boy.

994
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:05,937
How did he get my number?

995
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,073
Oh, he probably got it off the fridge.

996
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,555
Okay. And what was Kirk doing near our fridge?

997
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:11,395
It�s a long story.

998
00:41:11,488 --> 00:41:13,829
Okay, well, tell me later. I want to hear how the back-together date went.

999
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,974
It was very successful.

1000
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:16,013
Did he like the dress?

1001
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,028
The dress was a hit.

1002
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,220
I told you.

1003
00:41:18,323 --> 00:41:21,758
And, um, how was your, uh, date with Robert?

1004
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,506
Completely insane. You won�t believe the evening I had.

1005
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,532
Oh, tell me.

1006
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:28,839
So Robert and I get to the party, and Logan was there,

1007
00:41:28,937 --> 00:41:31,528
and at first everything was completely cas,

1008
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,646
and then as the evening went on, he got more and more jealous.

1009
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:35,374
Huh, really?

1010
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,583
Oh yeah. He wanted me to leave with him, blow off Robert.

1011
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:39,233
And did you?

1012
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:42,869
No, of course not. I told him that I came with Robert and I was leaving with Robert,

1013
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:44,578
and I walked away, and it was great.

1014
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:45,234
Sounds great.

1015
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:49,027
And since then, by the way, Logan has called twice today, we�re going out tonight,

1016
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,433
and we�ve already made plans for this week. Complete and total turn-around.

1017
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,413
Wow. Well, sounds like all the balls are in your court.

1018
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,908
Or, well, you know what I mean.

1019
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:58,244
You okay? You sound down.

1020
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:00,190
No, no, no. I�m fine. So what are you going to wear tonight?

1021
00:42:00,302 --> 00:42:02,028
Oh, I thought I�d go with the twenty-minute sweater.

1022
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,416
Oh, cute. Cute.

1023
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:07,930
The answer is no. Look, Jerry. I sold you the motor home. It is now yours.

1024
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:10,644
