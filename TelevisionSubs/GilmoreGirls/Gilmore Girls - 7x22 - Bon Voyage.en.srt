1
00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:02,222
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

2
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:04,423
I didn't get the internship
at the New York Times.

3
00:00:04,458 --> 00:00:05,078
What?

4
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:07,373
- We heard the song.
- It gave me goose bumps.

5
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:09,881
The way you locked eyes with him.

6
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:12,578
No, no, no. It's just karaoke.

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,065
You know I got swept up
in the lyrics and the moment.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,227
It didn't mean anything.

9
00:00:17,127 --> 00:00:18,633
Rory Gilmore...

10
00:00:18,764 --> 00:00:20,228
...will you marry me?

11
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:22,572
Lorelai Leigh Gilmore.

12
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:27,448
Logan�

13
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:28,881
I can't.

14
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:30,432
Goodbye, Rory.

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,426
I'm telling you, it's her.

16
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:45,634
- Trust me, it's not.
- It is.

17
00:00:45,635 --> 00:00:47,943
Why would Christiane Amanpour
be hanging out at the Dragonfly?

18
00:00:47,944 --> 00:00:48,682
I don't know.

19
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:49,941
- She wouldn't.
- She is.

20
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:51,446
You went up to her and said hi,
and she said,

21
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:53,123
"Hi, I'm Christiane Amanpour,
nice to meet you"?

22
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:54,857
No, I didn't go up to her at all.

23
00:00:54,892 --> 00:00:56,380
I looked at here and saw that it was her,

24
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:57,479
and I went to get you.

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,201
So I could look at
a fake Christiane Amanpour?

26
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:00,233
She's real.

27
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,238
Yeah. Remember the time when
you thought saw Sandra Day O'Connor?

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,212
Yeah well this is different and
I haven't had any cough syrup.

29
00:01:05,213 --> 00:01:06,577
I guarantee you it's not her.

30
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:08,885
You doubt my ability
to recognize a glamorous,

31
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:11,165
- international war correspondent?
- I guarantee you it's not her.

32
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,725
Oh, my god, that's Christiane Amanpour!

33
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:13,798
That's what I told you.

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,546
I can't meet Christiane Amanpour in my pajamas.

35
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:17,176
I tried to get you to change, you wouldn't change.

36
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,359
Well how long has she been here?

37
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,292
I don't know I just saw her eating breakfast

38
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:21,313
and I went home and got you. Hey, Michel,

39
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,531
Michel, how long has Christiane Amanpour been here?

40
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:25,983
Ah she checked in late last night, room 7.

41
00:01:25,984 --> 00:01:28,072
She's staying here?
You didn't tell me?

42
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:30,963
I wanted to avoid
yet another embarrassing incident.

43
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:32,034
What are you talking about?

44
00:01:32,035 --> 00:01:35,610
You always embarrass yourself
when celebrities stay at the inn.

45
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:36,467
I do not.

46
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:39,605
Jane Pauley, Harry Belafonte, Marisa Tomei.

47
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:40,492
He's right, you know?

48
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:43,022
No, no, Marisa Tomei's mother's best friend

49
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:44,474
is my hairdresser's cousin's roommate.

50
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:45,658
That's just freaky.

51
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:47,410
I'm just saying you
make them uncomfortable.

52
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:48,981
I run an inn. These are my guests.

53
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:50,673
What am I supposed to do -- ignore them?

54
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:51,986
I think that might be best.

55
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,089
I'm gonna go over and say hi
and see if she'll meet you.

56
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,809
What? Okay.
Wait. Don't be funny.

57
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:03,245
- Excuse me, Ms. Amanpour?
- yes.

58
00:02:03,246 --> 00:02:05,148
Hello, I'm Lorelai Gilmore.
I run the inn.

59
00:02:05,183 --> 00:02:06,620
Very nice to meet you. It's a lovely inn.

60
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:07,544
Thank you so much.

61
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:11,411
I'm sorry to bother you,
but my daughter is a huge fan of yours,

62
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:12,230
she always has been.

63
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,877
That's very nice to hear.
Thank you.

64
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, she just graduated
from Yale, actually,

65
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,906
where she was the editor
of the Yale Daily News.

66
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:18,561
That's great.

67
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,247
Anyway... she'd love to meet you,
if that's okay.

68
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,677
I'd love to. Is she here?

69
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:24,448
Yes, she is. Rory, come here.

70
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,891
Come on. Okay, here she is.

71
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:31,087
This is Rory Gilmore.
Rory, meet Christiane Amanpour.

72
00:02:31,088 --> 00:02:33,065
Hi, Rory. How are you?
Nice to meet you.

73
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,373
Nice to meet you, too.

74
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:35,865
I'm sorry to meet you in my pajamas.

75
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,628
I don't usually walk around town like this.

76
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:38,153
That's okay.

77
00:02:38,656 --> 00:02:40,823
I just think you are so inspiring.

78
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:42,829
Your reporting is so bold and moving and

79
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,060
fascinating and I know
you've won nine Emmys,

80
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,667
but I just don't think
that's enough not that you care

81
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:49,906
about that kind of thing,
but I just want to say thank you.

82
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:51,473
Thank you.
That's really nice of you.

83
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:53,474
And your mother says
that you've graduated Yale,

84
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:56,038
editor of the Yale Daily News --
that's not bad.

85
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,994
Oh, thank you.
I want to pursue a career in journalism.

86
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:02,475
That's good, is it print you want?
Television? CNN, maybe?

87
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:05,190
Oh, I'd love to work for a major daily.

88
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:06,301
Do you know which one?

89
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:08,133
Any one that will take me.

90
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:10,094
That's the spirit.
I mean you just get in there,

91
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:12,024
do what you can,
show them what you've got,

92
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,759
and the rest will take care of itself.

93
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,347
That's my plan.

94
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,908
Listen, I don't often do this,

95
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,713
but I'm going to give you my card,

96
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,412
and if you want to send me some stuff,

97
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,960
I'll have a look at it
and you know stay in touch.

98
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,177
-Seriously?
- Yes, yeah.

99
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:25,846
- Thank you.
- That's my cab out there,

100
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,821
so I'm gonna go now.
It was really nice to meet you.

101
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:28,348
Nice to meet you.

102
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,380
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Good luck. Take care.

103
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:31,418
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

104
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:36,349
I can't believe I just met
Christiane Amanpour in my pajamas.

105
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,473
Well, I'm sure you made an impression.

106
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:44,425
Subtitle by maglori

107
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,486
All right after "Great Adventure"
the next Roller coaster

108
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:40,023
could be here at Lake Compounds,
home of the "Boulder Dash".

109
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:40,661
Love it.

110
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:42,762
"The number one choice
of wooden roller coasters",

111
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:45,284
according to
Mr. Arthur Levin of about.com.

112
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,318
Oh, yes. The venerable Mr. Levin,
a legend in coast criticism.

113
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:48,987
So you've heard of him.

114
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,046
Well, of course.
What coast connoisseur hasn't?

115
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,646
"Great airtime", he says.

116
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:55,495
"Smooth ride, relentless speed
from start to finish".

117
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:56,914
You can admit it if you're scared.

118
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:58,737
What? I'm not scared, are you scared?

119
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:01,345
No, I'm not scared,
but I'm not the one who screams.

120
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,108
That happened once.

121
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:03,670
Nearly busted my eardrums.

122
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:04,884
You want to keep talking smack,

123
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,843
or you want to tell me what comes
after the Boulder Dash?

124
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:10,025
How about the "Cyclone" in Coney Island.

125
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,411
And then we can head west
to the "Millennium Force" in Ohio,

126
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,703
this calls it a "Giga Roller coaster".

127
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:15,892
You know what I say?

128
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,923
No hands, eyes open.
That's right, you heard me.

129
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,300
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- Well, believe it.

130
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:24,160
Okay, I am done.

131
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:26,567
74 r�sum�'s,
addressed and sealed.

132
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:27,925
Not at all excessive.

133
00:05:27,926 --> 00:05:30,280
Well, I just wanted to make sure
I didn't leave a stone unturned.

134
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:33,340
Yes rocks, pebbles, boulders...
they've all been turned.

135
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,110
Well, I got it all done
before our big trip.

136
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:37,766
Can you believe it?
Oh, man I have a lot of books.

137
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,867
Hey, there is a cool "State-Fare"
coaster in Springfield,

138
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:42,662
50-mile detour, worth it.

139
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:46,473
The rocket.

140
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,257
The rocket... 

141
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:50,503
Have you talked to him?

142
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,940
No.

143
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,326
It comes in waves, you know.

144
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,791
Big ones, really close together.

145
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,115
Well the waves will get smaller, I promise.

146
00:06:00,116 --> 00:06:02,996
Just have to give it time you know.

147
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,864
Have to feel sad and get through it.

148
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,151
Believe me.
I'm letting myself feel plenty sad.

149
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,080
Oh that's good.
I mean it's not good, you know,

150
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:10,834
under the circumstances, it's good.

151
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,239
I just can't imagine it feeling better.

152
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,941
But it will someday, I promise.

153
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,811
Yeah, do you feel better about Luke?

154
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:23,583
Ah, yeah. I feel better
because I think we're done.

155
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,545
What, maybe you guys
just need more time.

156
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,888
More time, I've given him
all the time in the world.

157
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:30,530
Every time I'm venerable
or I say something

158
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:33,484
or do something like the song
he doesn't do anything.

159
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,528
Well he's always been a little slow to respond.

160
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,526
Yeah I don't want to make any more excuses you know.

161
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,368
I just don't think he's over you.

162
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,311
Well it doesn't matter, I'm over him.

163
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,353
I need someone who can feel you know,

164
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,068
show me how he feels. He can't do that.

165
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:50,110
I guess that make sense.

166
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,380
Anyway we're batter as
friends you know, don't you think.

167
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,282
Like "Hey Luke can I get some coffee",

168
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,083
you know friends like that.

169
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,319
Like "Hey Luke can you make all the burgers

170
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,688
for Rory's re-enactment graduation party?" you know.

171
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,924
What re-enactment graduation party?

172
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,426
It's just a graduation re-enactment party we're gonna have

173
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,496
for all the people who couldn't go to your actual graduation.

174
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:09,497
Re-enactment, how?

175
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,766
All you have to do is throw on that cap and gown again,

176
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,201
you know and go up on a little podium again, that someone is gonna build

177
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,604
and listen to the high school band play "Pomp and Circumstance".

178
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,338
Mom!

179
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,140
What it's a party, it's gonna be fun!

180
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,631
Ah, you own me.

181
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,205
Okay I'll get you lots of cotton candy

182
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,418
and I won't make fun of you when you scream.

183
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm not gonna scream.

184
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,262
Once a screamer, always a screamer.

185
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,327
- I was seven.
- Like that counts.

186
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,053
All right, give me 300 hot dogs, 250 burgers.

187
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,521
- How about brats?
- No brats.

188
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,550
And enough buns, obviously, to go with all that.

189
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:39,298
Buns got it, you know brats go over very big at outdoor parties.

190
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,860
Yeah well I know the woman throwing the party,

191
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,363
and she and her daughter are dogs-and-burgers people.

192
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,799
Al right the party's Saturday, so I want delivery on Friday okay.

193
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,757
No sweat. I'll give you half off brats.

194
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,636
Somebody cancel a big order, Charlie?

195
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,404
I tried to tell her,

196
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,073
"Lady, nobody eats Bratwurst at a wedding."

197
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,241
Right. I'll see you, man. Thanks.

198
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:56,976
Hey Liz

199
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,845
Oh, hey, chuck, how you doing?

200
00:07:58,846 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm good.

201
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,893
There's your uncle Lukie! Say, "hi, uncle Lukie!"

202
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:04,719
HI Doula,

203
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,454
When she just stares like that, that's her way of saying hi.

204
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,255
Works for me. How you doing, Liz?

205
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,257
Oh pretty good. How about you?

206
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,393
Oh, god, I'm crazed. You want something to eat?

207
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,728
No, we just stopped by

208
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,629
'cause Doula misses her uncle Lukie. She really misses him.

209
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,400
Yeah look I cannot baby-sit today.

210
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,535
Please! I just need a little break

211
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,837
Come on I'm really swamped today al right.

212
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,272
Besides, I'm really trying to lay in the stuff

213
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,841
for Rory's party next week.

214
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,744
Please I really want to get something special for that party,

215
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,900
and every item of clothing that I own is covered in spit-up.

216
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,715
Sorry

217
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,684
Okay, if you can't do it, you can't do it.

218
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,919
So arr, did you give it to her?

219
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,187
What?

220
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,156
The necklace -- did you give it to Lorelai yet?

221
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,725
That was just a backup gift for Rory.

222
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:48,461
Oh come on that was no backup gift. And what about the song?

223
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,864
D..d.. f.. forget about the song. The song meant nothing.

224
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,965
We're friends. That's it.

225
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,134
Oh and you're good with being just friends.

226
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,936
- Yeah.
- I don't buy it.

227
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,738
Well then maybe you should give her the necklace then.

228
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:58,873
I'm really busy here

229
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,074
Fine, fine.

230
00:09:00,141 --> 00:09:03,310
Hey could you mix a sweet potato and a banana in a blender?

231
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,745
It's Doula's favorite.

232
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,614
Sure.  And don't slip out while I make it.

233
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,788
I don't see why Rory had to take this meeting

234
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,090
during our Friday night dinners.

235
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:16,791
Emily..

236
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,158
Well it's not even an interview.

237
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,393
If it was an interview, I would understand,

238
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,561
but it's a drink.

239
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,662
It's a contact, mom.

240
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,698
She's trying to remind him who she is.

241
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,366
As if anyone could forget.

242
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,195
I know. You know Rory wants to make sure

243
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:30,203
she's got her bases covered before we go out of town

244
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,871
so that she can relax and have fun.

245
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,407
But I don't think this drink should eat into our time.

246
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:35,709
Well maybe we'll stay later.

247
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,077
For after-dinner drinks?

248
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:37,978
Maybe.

249
00:09:39,144 --> 00:09:41,247
So, how long will you two be gone?

250
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,616
Oh, a couple weeks, a month.

251
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,684
You're riding roller coasters for a month?

252
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,052
As long as our stomachs can take it.

253
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,454
This is what Yale graduates do?

254
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,356
Mother she's tired.
She needs a break.

255
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,857
Plus, this might be my last shot

256
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,726
You last shot, what are you talking about?

257
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,132
Well, she's gonna get a job, and who knows where?

258
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,233
You know, she's gonna move on.

259
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,397
This might be the last time I

260
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:59,047
I can really spend time with her like this.

261
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,368
Honestly, Lorelai, must you be so maudlin?

262
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,036
I'm not being maudlin. I'm being realistic.

263
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,271
So, how are things at the inn?

264
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,174
Oh, good. Busy, but good.

265
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,608
I have an idea for you.

266
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,276
- Oh, no.
- Hmm?

267
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,479
Oh, no, don't stop there. Go on.

268
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,781
I think you should add a spa to your inn.

269
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,049
A spa?

270
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,751
Yes, spas are exploding.

271
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,052
Sounds dangerous.

272
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:19,920
All of our friends

273
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,422
are trading island vacations for spa holidays

274
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,423
I don't know, mom.

275
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,346
When I was the Ballantyne Resort, it got me thinking.

276
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:28,061
This is really something I think you should do.

277
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,630
Small country inns are old news, Lorelai.

278
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,266
Destination spas are what everyone's talking about.

279
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,801
Mom, I told you business is good.

280
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,704
I don't need to rub people with rocks or wrap them in seaweed.

281
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,372
Well, the travel market is fickle.

282
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,307
It wouldn't hurt to stay ahead of the curve.

283
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,143
I don't have the money for expansion
Ooh here she is,

284
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,780
Will you at least think about it before you say no?

285
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,181
Yes, I will think about it.

286
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:48,949
- hi
- hi

287
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,650
Hi, sorry I'm late.

288
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:51,184
How were the drinks?

289
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,453
Good, I got a job.

290
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,921
- What tonight?
- Tonight?

291
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,457
I leave in three days. I can't leave in three days.

292
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,692
Whe�Wha�Leave where?

293
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,093
What's the job, honey?

294
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,429
Well, I was having drinks with Hugo Gray, right?

295
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,264
Who's this Hugo Gray?

296
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,666
He runs an online magazine. Rory's been writing for him.

297
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,649
So we were just talking about different opportunities

298
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,368
that might come up and where I've already applied,

299
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,160
and he mentioned that the reporter

300
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,274
that was covering the Barack Obama campaign for him

301
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,037
dropped out because his fianc�e
got a job in Dubai, so they're moving.

302
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:17,899
- Wow..

303
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,314
So Hugo asked me if that was something I'd be interested in

304
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,935
and I said "yes I would be interested"

305
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:23,480
and he told me more about it and

306
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,210
apparently I would be on the campaign trail

307
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,720
with the other reporters

308
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,488
the planes, the buses, the whole deal.

309
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,091
And I mean it's only an online magazine,

310
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,626
so I wouldn't be staying where the
wall street journal people stay at night but�

311
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,728
Who cares?

312
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:35,996
But I would be traveling with them

313
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,298
I'd be filing stories from the
road right up until the convention.

314
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,367
So have you talked salary yet?

315
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,801
Yeah, it's next to nothing

316
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,337
but all my meals and travel and hotels would be covered,

317
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,872
so I wouldn't have that many expenses.

318
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,774
Well that's fine. You're just starting out.

319
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,410
Plus, it sounds like you'll be making excellent contacts.

320
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,845
I would be.

321
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,178
It could be quite grueling, Rory

322
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,828
all that constant travel, the seedy motels.

323
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,050
She can handle it.

324
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,852
I hope so. I said yes.

325
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,120
That's great.

326
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,388
It is, right?

327
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,424
Ah you're gonna be working on a presidential campaign.

328
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,260
I know but that also mean in three
days I'd be leaving for who knows how long.

329
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,863
It could be two months, it could be two years if Barack does well.

330
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,197
And what does that mean

331
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,199
I'm only gonna come home on holidays? That's crazy.

332
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,636
And I need some transition time, and the roller coasters -

333
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:17,505
how am I gonna go on all the roller coasters

334
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,707
if I have to leave and have to be in Iowa on Monday

335
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,075
at the town hall meeting

336
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,544
at the quality inn and suites ballroom in Sioux city?

337
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,779
You're gonna be fine.

338
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,015
What about the roller coasters?

339
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,817
We'll do it another time.

340
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,320
This is what you've been working for.

341
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,289
Yeah. I guess it is.

342
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,727
I would have credentials -- real press credentials.

343
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:41,861
Isn't that crazy?

344
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,463
It's not crazy.

345
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,299
So, this is it

346
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,002
This is the last time we'll see you

347
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,404
for who knows how long.

348
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,574
Oh, yeah, I guess it is.

349
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,014
After-dinner drinks for sure.

350
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:04,618
Hear, hear.

351
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,319
But this list they gave me is just ridiculous.

352
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,025
Where am I gonna find a laptop car adapter by tomorrow?

353
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,761
24-hour laptop-car-adapter store.

354
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:14,762
Seriously, mom.

355
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,331
Well honey that's our mission today. We'll buy or borrow.

356
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,932
Hey, Caesar, is Luke around?

357
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:21,075
- Sure. How are we today, ladies?
- we're fine

358
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,703
We'll be finer with a little coffee

359
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,770
Two to go, please.

360
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:26,530
With pleasure. Hey, Luke, you
got company. Here, let me take that.

361
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,685
- I got it.
- Let me.
- I'm fine.

362
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:28,408
It's not a problem.

363
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,211
- It's becoming one. Take it. All right.
- Sorry.

364
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,846
- Hey, hey Rory!
- Hi.

365
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,594
Hi, what was all that about?

366
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,716
Oh he's just trying to show me

367
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:39,019
he can handle things, you know if I leave.

368
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:39,620
If?

369
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,755
Well t he boat trip's been cancelled,

370
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:44,879
but Caesar's got it in his
head that I'm gonna leave at some point

371
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,543
so he can prove he can -- whatever.

372
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,196
Java one, java two.

373
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,750
Thanks So, Luke... Remember all the burgers and

374
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:55,902
hot dogs I ordered for
Rory's party a week from Saturday?

375
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,203
I have to cancel them.

376
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,972
- Why?
- Well the party's cancelled.

377
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,609
Wait a second, did you just say
Rory's graduation party is cancelled?

378
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,345
Oh ho, it's good news. Someone got a job.

379
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,646
What job?

380
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,215
I'm gonna be a reporter for an online magazine.

381
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,217
Oh it's better than that -- she's going to Iowa,

382
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,550
and she's gonna be on the
campaign bus with Barack Obama.

383
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,024
- No party at all?
- Babette.

384
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,859
Congratulations. That's great news.

385
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,862
Thank you. Yeah I'm really excited, but I'm nervous.

386
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,464
I have to be a real reporter, yikes.

387
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,965
You'll be a great one.

388
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,235
She will, so, sorry, but no Rory, no party.

389
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,704
But you promised us a re-enactment.

390
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,406
We can still do the re-enactment.

391
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,474
Remember my suggestion -- Lulu plays Rory?

392
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,409
It's not the same, Kirk. And I was so looking forward to

393
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,345
having a good cry at the re-enactment..

394
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,849
Uh, okay. You want a re-enactment?

395
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,252
We can, we can give you one right, right now.

396
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,922
Uh come on, Rory. Okay, so watch this.

397
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:55,462
Okay, and, everybody,
the graduate, Lorelai Leigh Gilmore.

398
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,985
Ooh. Ooh. Here you go. And shake the hand.

399
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:58,486
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

400
00:14:58,486 --> 00:15:02,069
And you are one of tomorrow's future leaders today.

401
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,303
I am so happy.

402
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,972
I am so glad to have graduated Summa-cum-Luke.

403
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,643
And then the thing.  Okay. Yay!

404
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,379
That's not how I imagined it.

405
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:14,850
I'm sorry, guys. I wish we could do the party.

406
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:18,812
I really do. We just don't have
time. She's leaving in two days.

407
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:22,132
-Two days?
- I know. It's really soon.

408
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,824
We just have a lot to do.

409
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,759
So this is goodbye?

410
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:29,257
No this isn't goodbye, I'm gonna come
by tomorrow and visit everybody

411
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,697
I'm not ready for this to be the real goodbye.

412
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,632
Yeah this is more like a "see you later."

413
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,301
Yeah, I'll see you guys later.

414
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,203
Okay? So see you later.

415
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,538
-Bye
-Bye

416
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:46,930
Bye, dollfaces.  No party.

417
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:53,787
Hey.

418
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:55,122
Hey, Luke, how's it going?

419
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,790
Good. It's going good. How are you?

420
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,825
Ooh Good. Hey, I apologize for the smell in here,

421
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,293
but I'm making bouillabaisse.

422
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,028
It's kind of at the stinkiest part --

423
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,663
a lot of uncooked fish and garlic.

424
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,998
It smells good to me.

425
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,034
Well you're very kind. You looking for Lorelai?

426
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,301
'Cause she's out and about,

427
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:09,871
and I don't know when she's coming back.

428
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,905
Yeah, I know. I saw her in town.

429
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:14,441
- oh. Yeah.
- Yeah. So, what's up?

430
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:18,545
Well, you know she cancelled Rory's graduation party?

431
00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:21,548
Yeah. I mean I knew that kid
wouldn't last a whole summer at home

432
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,750
before landing some kind of amazing job,

433
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,423
but, god, it happened so lightning fast.

434
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:28,488
You know I was thinking maybe we should throw it anyway.

435
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:28,984
Oh, yeah?

436
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,686
Yeah, I mean it's a week sooner than we planned,

437
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,130
but there's no reason we can't do it.

438
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:33,131
I guess not.

439
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,352
And I think we should make it a surprise party.

440
00:16:35,353 --> 00:16:37,230
Who doesn't love a surprise?

441
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,166
Yeah I got all the hot dogs and the hamburgers,

442
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,168
and the buns are on their way today anyway.

443
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,636
You know, that's a very sweet idea Luke.

444
00:16:42,703 --> 00:16:44,371
Yeah, I think Rory would really love it.

445
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,739
I think Lorelai would love it.

446
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,262
- Yeah, Rory and Lorelai.
- Yeah, Rory and Lorelai.

447
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:49,276
I think we should do it!

448
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,578
All right. I'll start telling everybody.

449
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:52,846
Okay what do you need from me?

450
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:53,847
Desserts.

451
00:16:53,914 --> 00:16:55,415
Aha! Well, I'm all over it.

452
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,351
Give Jackson a call.: He'll help you with whatever you need.

453
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,254
-Al right Okay, thanks, Sookie.
- Okay.
- All right, bye.

454
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,195
I don't know, I think it would have made more sense

455
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,873
to get a regular-sized
shampoo bottle instead of 20 tiny ones.

456
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,200
With the big bottle you got to lug it off and on the bus.

457
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,735
Lug! How big do they make them?

458
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,871
Look the little bottles give you as
much shampoo without the weight.

459
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:19,973
Perfect for travel -- plus, they're cute.

460
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,675
Al right. Oh, I want to stop by the post office.

461
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:23,410
I want to get tons of blank postcards.

462
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,045
You are gonna get so many postcards.

463
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,146
You could just e-mail me.

464
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,348
Yeah but postcard-sending is a dying art form.

465
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:29,484
Right, and it's nice to get mail.

466
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:30,226
Sure.

467
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:31,418
Plus, we'll talk all the time.

468
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,120
Yeah. What else do you need?

469
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,388
Um, a mini book light.

470
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,023
Ah man I had a mini book light, but I lent it to Paris.

471
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,359
And by "lent," I mean she totally stole it.

472
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,094
I think we have a mini book light in the lost

473
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,829
and found at the inn. It's been there like a month.

474
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,542
Oh poor rejected book light.

475
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,760
Maybe you should adopt it and give it the love it needs..

476
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,335
All right. Check.

477
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:52,360
What else do we need?
Ooh, hey, I have a great idea. Come here.

478
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:53,361
What, where are we going?

479
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,941
Remember last year when Miss Patty hurt her back

480
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,743
during rehearsal for spring fling?

481
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,945
Oh yeah she should have never demonstrated the Jet�s

482
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,180
for the little daffodils.

483
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,756
She had one of those back-support things

484
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:02,959
that you put on top of chairs.

485
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,131
I bet she'd loan that to you.

486
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:07,254
Yeah but do I really want to be
known as "back-support-thingy girl"?

487
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,289
AH, hello, two-hour speech, metal folding chairs,

488
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,191
and now I'll take questions for an hour.

489
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,627
Just call me "back-support-thingy girl."

490
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,050
That's weird. She never locks this.

491
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:16,406
- Miss Patty?
- Miss Patty?

492
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,836
- Oh, hello, girls.
- Hi, is everything okay?

493
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,164
Oh, yes, everything is fine.

494
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,936
I'M...consulting with my muse.

495
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:26,955
Your muse?

496
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:29,893
Yes! whenever I want to think up a new dance routine,

497
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:32,384
I come in here alone, lie down on the floor in the dark,

498
00:18:32,385 --> 00:18:36,483
and I let the muse inspire me. Did you want something?

499
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,719
That's okay, we'll come back
when you're not with your muse.

500
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,174
- Okay, good.
- Okay, well, so we'll...

501
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:43,625
- See you later.

502
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,825
- Odd.
- Very odd.

503
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,763
Okay, they're gone.

504
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,907
Good. Let's get this meeting going.

505
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:55,135
Once again, this is not a "meeting," per se.

506
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,503
We have already broken several Robert's rules of order.

507
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,816
So don't tell Robert.

508
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:01,190
Yeah besides, isn't it worth breaking rules over?

509
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:02,322
It is Rory, for god's sake.

510
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:05,037
So lets start divvying up the
duties, who's gonna do the food?

511
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,014
I got hot dogs and hamburgers
and a couple of big grills in the square,

512
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:10,050
and Sookie's got the rest covered, right Jackson?

513
00:19:10,117 --> 00:19:11,585
She's at home baking right now.

514
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,754
You name the fruit, it'll be in one of her pies.

515
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,489
Can she make a sour-cream/peach pie?

516
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,123
I'll put it on the list.

517
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,024
I'd like a blackberry.

518
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:18,960
Oh she makes a wicked blackberry and cranberry.

519
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:22,396
What about cherry? Cherry is a classic.

520
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:26,400
Please, could we stay focused?

521
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,502
People, this gathering is unofficial,

522
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,305
as such I would like to have
it over with as soon as possible.

523
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:34,318
Now, Luke, I assume you have obtained permits to use

524
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,833
two large grills with open flame on our town square?

525
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,413
Uh, no, I don't, I don't have any permits.

526
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,648
I just, I just started this whole thing a couple hours ago.

527
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:46,153
Outdoor barbecuing sans permit is a violation of town codes.

528
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,088
As selectman, I can't approve that.

529
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,923
Hey Taylor If this meeting is unofficial,

530
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,025
then whatever you say is unofficial,

531
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:53,226
so Luke's barbecuing, what else.

532
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,828
Music. There's got to be music.

533
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,164
- Yeah, who's got a good sound system?
- Yo!

534
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,599
I believe I can also be of some help in this area.

535
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,069
I'd gladly donate my time and expertise as deejay.

536
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,137
Did a little deejay work back in college.

537
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,839
Went by the moniker "Captain K."

538
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,741
He's really good at scratching.

539
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,110
- Yeah we've all seen that.
- Okay what about decorations?

540
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:12,946
I have a bunch of stuff left
from a school birthday party -

541
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,381
Mylar balloons, streamers.

542
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:16,717
There are not going to be any Mylar balloons.

543
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,786
They are infamous for floating up and catching on power lines.

544
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,788
It could cause an outage for the whole town.

545
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:24,858
The closest power lines are six miles out of town.

546
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,960
Nonetheless�

547
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:29,463
Nonetheless, Lulu, why don't you bring those balloons

548
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,864
and whatever else you got?

549
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:34,234
You people are violating town ordinances left and right.

550
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,702
This is highly irregular.

551
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,305
Dude, you're who's highly irregular.

552
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,241
Excuse me?

553
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,909
I don't know what your problem is,

554
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:44,778
but the town wants to throw this party,

555
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,346
and you're either gonna join us

556
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,482
or you're gonna stay home and comb your beard.

557
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:50,884
Okay, all right,

558
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:52,586
we're gonna need chairs and tables

559
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,888
and volunteers to set them up around the gazebo.

560
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:56,666
Okay we're all gonna get started in the square

561
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,166
tonight after dark, okay?

562
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,829
This will remain an unofficial party, you hear men, unofficial!

563
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,130
You should come along. It would be fun.

564
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,985
No you need some alone time with Lane.

565
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:08,897
Yeah but it's cutting into our you-and-me time.

566
00:21:08,898 --> 00:21:09,898
That would seem like a long time, right?

567
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:11,473
There's plenty of time.

568
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,274
36 hours is not plenty of time.

569
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:16,678
That's not true. Imagine if you had a 36-hour flight.

570
00:21:16,744 --> 00:21:18,546
- That would seem like a long time, right?
-Yeah.

571
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,382
All right plus, I have to go to Sookie and Jackson's

572
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,117
- to get you that fanny pack.
- Really?

573
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:22,968
What "really"?

574
00:21:22,969 --> 00:21:24,874
You honestly think I'm gonna wear a fanny pack?

575
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:27,381
All I know is, it's on the list, and if it's on the list,

576
00:21:27,382 --> 00:21:28,481
I'm getting it for you.

577
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:30,024
You think Tom Brokaw's mother

578
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:32,227
sent him off to his first campaign with no fanny pack?

579
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:33,995
When, when in my right mind would I�

580
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,097
Perhaps the senator might like a piece of gum,

581
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:38,266
and no one has any, and then they say,

582
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,136
"what about that girl with the lime-green fanny pack?"

583
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:43,037
"Lime-green" I would be "Lime-green fanny pack girl."

584
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:44,572
And they bring you over to him, and he says,

585
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:46,474
"Hello young lady, what is your name?"

586
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,576
"My name's Rory Gilmore. Here's your gum."

587
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:50,311
And like that, you're gum buddies with

588
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:52,647
the future president of the United States!

589
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,649
Oh when you put it that way -- gum buddies.

590
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,618
All right look, I'll meet you back at home, okay?

591
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,520
Okay but take a nap, 'cause we're staying up really late.

592
00:21:58,586 --> 00:22:00,063
- I don't need a nap to stay up really late.
- Okay.

593
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:01,589
Give my love to Lane and the boys.

594
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,391
-I will. Bye.
- Bye.

595
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:07,211
-Billy Fink.
- You did not!

596
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:09,465
-  I did.
- But Dave Rogalski.

597
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:11,166
Not technically my first kiss.

598
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,600
How did I not know this?

599
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,833
I was too ashamed to ever tell you.

600
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,472
I mean how would you
feel if your first kiss was Billy Fink?

601
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,808
Well just 'cause he didn't come out of the gates strong

602
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:21,443
doesn't mean he didn't turn into a very handsome,

603
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:22,763
dashing billionaire.

604
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:24,779
He didn't, I ran into him a few years ago,

605
00:22:24,846 --> 00:22:27,349
and he's living with his mom and sells shoes in Norwich.

606
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,684
Oh. Well, maybe he'll sell billions of shoes.

607
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:32,754
How weird is this?

608
00:22:32,821 --> 00:22:34,789
Yesterday we're sitting on your porch playing jacks

609
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:37,618
and praying to grow boobs, and now look at us.

610
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,861
I have a husband and two babies in there,

611
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:42,063
and you're about to go off and conquer the world,

612
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,398
or at least write about it.

613
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:45,233
We've come a long way, baby.

614
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,585
- I'll say.
- Babe.
- Yeah.

615
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:48,337
Can I talk to you a sec?

616
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:49,338
- Sure what's up?
- In private.

617
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:51,673
- Oh, well, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

618
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,707
- Sorry, Rory.
- No problem.

619
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:56,751
- The kids okay?
- Sound asleep.

620
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:57,719
They what's going on?

621
00:22:57,779 --> 00:22:58,741
I just got a call from Luke,

622
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:00,737
and they want to start setting up
the square for the party tomorrow.

623
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:01,561
Yeah so?

624
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:04,535
So the honoree is sitting on our
porch looking out onto the square,

625
00:23:04,536 --> 00:23:06,281
and they can't set up until she goes home.

626
00:23:06,282 --> 00:23:07,567
It's my last night with my best friend.

627
00:23:07,568 --> 00:23:08,849
Well, could you move it along,

628
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,860
because it's getting late and we were just trying�

629
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:16,139
Hey, I'm just the messenger.
You're done when you're done.

630
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,335
- I'll let them know.
-U-Hmm.

631
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:26,969
Sorry about that. What's wrong?

632
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:32,061
I don't know. In the past two minutes sitting here,

633
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:34,257
I've managed to completely freak myself out.

634
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:38,050
The call I haven't really had a
chance to stop and think about it,

635
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:41,495
but I just stopped and thought, and I am really nervous.

636
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:43,073
Totally understandable.

637
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:45,824
But I'm, like, panic-attack nervous.

638
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:49,551
Rory, you're gonna do an amazing job, okay? You always do.

639
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:51,382
- See? I hate that.
- What?

640
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:53,864
Everyone thinking I'm gonna
do an amazing job all the time,

641
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,547
like it's a given. It's not a
given. What if I'm a terrible reporter?

642
00:23:57,548 --> 00:23:59,273
Then you'll figure out how to get better.

643
00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:08,497
gonna do an amazing job is because everybody knows you.

644
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:10,155
Yeah, you're gonna be nervous.

645
00:24:10,156 --> 00:24:12,743
I mean I was nervous before I had the babies.

646
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,976
I was throwing up all the time.

647
00:24:13,977 --> 00:24:14,774
You were pregnant.

648
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,874
True, but that was 30% pregnancy,

649
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,220
70% fear of being the world's worst mom.

650
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:20,824
I don't know.

651
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:24,619
I just don't know about just
picking up and leaving until who knows

652
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,782
when and leaving my mom -- see? I'm not ready.

653
00:24:28,783 --> 00:24:30,913
What reporter freaks out about leaving their mom?

654
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:34,588
- The lucky kind.
- It's embarrassing.

655
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:36,488
How is she holding up?

656
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:38,901
She's fine. She's not freaked out at all.

657
00:24:38,902 --> 00:24:40,937
She's making lists and buying fanny packs.

658
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,515
She's not even a little bit sentimental.

659
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,934
- Your mom?
- Yeah. She's really fine.

660
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,916
I'm sure she's freaking out on the inside.

661
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,710
I don't know. Maybe.

662
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:57,958
- Lane...
- Yeah?

663
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:05,368
I just� your friendship means so much to me. It's so...

664
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,162
Me, too.

665
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:12,140
I mean, I don't know what it's like to have a sister,

666
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:13,370
but I feel like I do, you know?

667
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:21,575
- Yeah.
- Mrs. Van Gerbig.
- Ms. Gilmore

668
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,662
- Hey.
- Oh, hey!

669
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:30,487
You're ironing?

670
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:33,169
The flatter the clothes, the more will fit in your suitcase.

671
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,851
- Oh right.
- How was Lane's?

672
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:37,156
It was sad, saying goodbye.

673
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:40,288
I'll bet. Oh Sookie wants you to come by tomorrow

674
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:42,348
and say goodbye to her.
I made her a promise that you would.

675
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:42,771
Sure.

676
00:25:42,772 --> 00:25:44,477
And I got that fanny pack from Jackson.

677
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,701
I think you're right.  you're never gonna wear it unless

678
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:48,828
you want to be relentlessly
teased but the other reporters.

679
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:49,586
Not so much.

680
00:25:49,587 --> 00:25:50,959
But who knows? Maybe you should take it.

681
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,148
You know maybe they're teasing
reporters who don't have fanny packs.

682
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:55,491
Who knows what the reporter teasing edict is these days.

683
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:56,561
- Mom.
- Yeah?

684
00:25:56,762 --> 00:25:58,611
- I don't get it.
- What?

685
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,617
How can you be so okay with everything?

686
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:02,317
Ever since I've told you that I'm leaving,

687
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:04,472
you're just all busy with shopping and packing,

688
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:06,683
and you seem fine with it.

689
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:11,011
- It's too soon.
- What?

690
00:26:11,957 --> 00:26:15,706
If I stop to think about you leaving now, I'm gonna fall apart.

691
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,247
We still have time left. It's too soon.

692
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:28,706
Here. I'll iron. You fold.

693
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:41,007
Hey, guys, only six chairs to a table.

694
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:43,492
I think we can go eight if we
grab more from the high school.

695
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:45,848
The door's chained, but I
can slip through, I'm skinny like that.

696
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:48,262
Six is fine. Not everybody's gonna be sitting down at once.

697
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,180
- We found enough tablecloths.
-Great.

698
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:53,267
It turns out that East-Side Tillie
had a stash down in her basement.

699
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,190
Woke her up out of a dead sleep.

700
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:58,638
- She couldn't have been more annoyed. It was fantastic.
- Thanks.

701
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:00,814
Hey Luke, I got the turntable. What's next?

702
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:02,568
Why don't you help Kirk and Lulu with the lights.

703
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:03,439
Okay will do.

704
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,826
Kirk, careful stringing those lights, okay?

705
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:09,021
One of those light bulbs blows, and the whole thing's useless.

706
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,391
Luke, what do you think about these?

707
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:11,353
What do I think about what?

708
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:12,575
- The centerpieces.
- Oh nice.

709
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:15,277
- Sookie's idea, my vegetables.
- All right, great. Thanks.

710
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,881
- Luuuuuke! Luke!
- Yeah, Babette, over here.

711
00:27:18,882 --> 00:27:22,448
Oh, Luke! My ankles! Look at my ankles!

712
00:27:22,449 --> 00:27:23,331
Should I ask why?

713
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:25,482
- Bad news, doll, it's gonna rain.
- What?

714
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:26,929
Oh, yeah look at these ankles.

715
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,036
They haven't been this swollen since hurricane bob.

716
00:27:29,037 --> 00:27:30,751
So then I checked the weather channel, and sure enough,

717
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:32,107
Nick Walker confirmed it.

718
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,073
There's a storm front moving in over Connecticut.

719
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:34,874
It's gonna rain tomorrow?

720
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:37,850
First thing in the AM, Nick Walker -- you a Nick Walker fan?

721
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:40,006
-No.
- Oh, you should be.

722
00:27:40,007 --> 00:27:43,386
He's just terrific -- always dead on and so charming

723
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:45,734
Of course, I've always had a thing for meteorologists.

724
00:27:45,735 --> 00:27:47,980
They're kinda like astronauts crossed with fortune tellers,

725
00:27:47,981 --> 00:27:50,931
- very intriguing Anyway, he says it's definite.
-  Oh.

726
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:53,450
Yeah, so I thought you'd want to know.

727
00:27:53,451 --> 00:27:55,423
Sorry for the bad news, but you know my ankles.

728
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:56,895
No, that's true. They're never wrong.

729
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:58,986
No, no, My hair's only 50-50, but my ankles

730
00:27:58,987 --> 00:27:59,990
you could take them to the bank.

731
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:00,986
What we gonna do?

732
00:28:01,487 --> 00:28:02,828
We could have it in the diner.

733
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:03,829
We could have it in the diner.

734
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,474
How you gonna fit 200 people in a diner?

735
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,477
In shifts?

736
00:28:05,983 --> 00:28:06,815
Oh what a shame.

737
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,207
Maybe we can break the party up into people's houses,

738
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:10,061
like little party stations.

739
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:11,738
You gonna wake up the whole town and arrange that?

740
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:13,085
It sounded dumb while I was saying it.

741
00:28:13,086 --> 00:28:14,254
I can't believe it's gonna rain tomorrow.

742
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:16,152
You don't suppose anybody has any idea where

743
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,371
we could get a big wedding tent at one o'clock in the morning?

744
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,895
It was a nice idea, man.

745
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:09,784
Why is no one picking up their phones?

746
00:30:09,785 --> 00:30:11,158
I want to say goodbye to everyone.

747
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,485
We'll track them all down, I promise. Rory, look.

748
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:24,914
I think you're gonna get to say goodbye to everybody.

749
00:30:33,402 --> 00:30:36,466
- Did you...
- No, I didn't do a thing.

750
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:08,383
We love you, Rory!

751
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:11,760
We're so proud of you.

752
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:27,062
Rory, in my official capacity as town sash presenter,

753
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:28,772
I would like to present you with this sash,

754
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:32,879
which I also happened to make in
my official capacity as town sash maker.

755
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,956
Well, thank you.

756
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:35,026
Kneel before me.

757
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:38,752
All right, could you at least bow your head a little bit?

758
00:31:40,528 --> 00:31:41,767
Wow. That's quite a sash.

759
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:43,857
I got the material from one of mother's nighties.

760
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:47,358
We wouldn't let you go without a party, sweetheart!

761
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,625
All right, no shoving. Let's make a line.

762
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:51,420
Everybody gets a chance to hug Rory.

763
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:54,565
I see mom and dad. I'll be right back.

764
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:58,859
- Hey.
- This is quite a party.

765
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:00,521
I know. It is, isn't it?

766
00:32:00,522 --> 00:32:02,512
We had to cancel a lunch with the Stuttgart's because

767
00:32:02,513 --> 00:32:04,451
we only heard about it from Sookie last night.

768
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:05,662
Emily, that hardly matters.

769
00:32:05,663 --> 00:32:08,241
I didn't say it mattered. I was merely relaying the fact.

770
00:32:08,915 --> 00:32:10,637
Well, anyway, I'm glad you're here.

771
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:11,853
We wouldn't miss it.

772
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:13,766
Of course we wouldn't. We're her grandparents.

773
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,347
I can't believe they did this for her.

774
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:19,283
I don't think this is all for Rory.

775
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,738
I think this party's a testament to you, Lorelai,

776
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:24,128
and the home you've created here.

777
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:27,102
-I regret that you needed�
- Richard.

778
00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:30,116
Now, let me finish, Emily. I regret it,

779
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:34,541
- and we've�recent experience have taught me�
- Oh, please

780
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:36,523
don't become one of those "I had a heart attack,

781
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:38,438
let me express my every thought" types.

782
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:42,891
Not every thought, dear, just this one. It takes a r

783
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:47,969
A remarkable person to inspire all of this.

784
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:51,895
Thanks, dad.

785
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:56,171
Okay, that's enough.

786
00:32:56,172 --> 00:32:57,877
It's not as though the two
of you are saying goodbye.

787
00:32:57,878 --> 00:33:00,230
May I have your attention, please?

788
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:04,413
I'd like to welcome you all
to this Bon Voyage party

789
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:08,935
in honor of one of Stars Hollow's
favorite daughters, Ms. Rory Gilmore!

790
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,848
I've known Rory,
as have most of you...

791
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:20,464
Have you given any thought
to my spa idea?

792
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,009
Oh, yeah. I don't think
I'm interested, though.

793
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,303
...Glorious spring day,
pregnant with pride and anticipation,

794
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:30,716
preparing to birth you
from our collective womb,

795
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,072
fully gestated and nourished.

796
00:33:34,073 --> 00:33:37,006
And so we breathe deep,
and, with these last,

797
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:40,834
painful contractions,
we push you out into the world,

798
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:44,621
spank your bottom, and wipe the amniotic fluid

799
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:49,320
from your eyes as you issue your first independent breath.

800
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:52,006
- Is this speech making you a little queasy?
- A little bit.

801
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,859
Rory, would you like to say a few words?

802
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,741
Thank you, Taylor, for that very unique tribute.

803
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:12,206
Um... I love this place. I...I just loved growing up here,

804
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:13,122
and I love all of you.

805
00:34:13,123 --> 00:34:16,559
And thank you so much for doing all of this.

806
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,299
It's amazing. I just -- it's so -- oh, I'm on the verge of gushing,

807
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,682
so I'm just gonna stop myself here.

808
00:34:22,683 --> 00:34:25,902
I don't want to gush, except one more thing -- to my mom,

809
00:34:26,903 --> 00:34:30,865
who is just everything to me and everything I am

810
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:33,885
and who I'm gonna miss so much.

811
00:34:43,268 --> 00:34:44,987
All right, let's get this party started.

812
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,893
- No bratwurst?
- No bratwurst.

813
00:34:54,894 --> 00:34:56,020
- Just corn, then.

814
00:34:56,021 --> 00:34:57,765
- What can I get you?
- Can't decide.

815
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:00,242
Hey Luke, I'll have two hamburgers, medium rare.

816
00:35:00,243 --> 00:35:01,093
- Hold on a sec.
- Lorelai,

817
00:35:01,094 --> 00:35:03,410
we really should be going, but I want to say goodbye to Rory.

818
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:04,469
I guess I'll eat later.

819
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,432
Now, listen, instead of a spa, what about a tennis court?

820
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:11,378
People love tennis. You could put a bubble over it.

821
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:12,028
Oh, god.

822
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:15,175
Outside the inn you could use it during the summer and winter.

823
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:16,187
There's really no downside.

824
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:22,008
have discussed it, and we are willing to loan you the money.

825
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:22,927
Oh, mother.

826
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:25,164
Standard terms, no interest.

827
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,941
Mom, why do you want to loan me money?

828
00:35:26,942 --> 00:35:30,223
All it would require is the three
of us sit down and hash out the details.

829
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:32,605
Obviously we want to get together with you from time

830
00:35:32,606 --> 00:35:34,168
to time to see how things are progressing,

831
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:35,770
but we wouldn't become pests about it.

832
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,435
Mom, why don't we just talk about it Friday night at dinner?

833
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:47,537
Oh, so our Friday-night dinners are going to continue, then?

834
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:52,046
Well, we might as well. I've kind of gotten used to it.

835
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,060
All right. That sounds fine. But don't be late and don't wear jeans.

836
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,365
When have I ever worn jeans to dinner?

837
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:04,613
Well I don't know, it could very
well be Rory who enforces the dress code.

838
00:36:04,614 --> 00:36:06,643
I'm just saying I don't think that jeans are appropriate.

839
00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:09,019
Fine, spandex and a tube top it is.

840
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,029
- Hey.
- Hey.
- My dear.

841
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:15,303
Oh, thank you. Now, listen, you keep in touch,

842
00:36:15,304 --> 00:36:17,570
and not just postcards -- phone calls as well.

843
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:18,095
Of course.

844
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:23,482
It's an honor to be your grandmother, Rory Gilmore.

845
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:28,717
Well, thank you, I� thank you for everything.

846
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:30,285
Oh, dear.

847
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:32,427
I'll walk you guys to your car.

848
00:36:35,269 --> 00:36:36,774
- Hey.
- Hey!

849
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:38,355
It's beautiful, isn't it?

850
00:36:38,356 --> 00:36:40,576
It's so beautiful. I can't believe you pulled it off.

851
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,750
No, I just did all the baking. This was all Luke.

852
00:36:43,751 --> 00:36:44,587
What?

853
00:36:45,317 --> 00:36:47,639
He made me promise not to tell you, but I don't care.

854
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,565
This is all Luke. He did all of it.

855
00:36:50,566 --> 00:36:53,039
He's the one that came to me and said, "let's do the party,"

856
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,003
and then he planned the secret town meeting, everything.

857
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:57,207
Really?

858
00:36:57,208 --> 00:37:00,516
Yeah. I mean last night when we thought it was gonna rain

859
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:01,713
and we'd have to cancel the party,

860
00:37:01,714 --> 00:37:05,963
he went around and collected
everybody's tarps and tents and raincoats.

861
00:37:05,964 --> 00:37:08,237
I don't know how he did it.

862
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:10,195
He must have stayed up all night doing this.

863
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:11,390
Can you believe that?

864
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:16,418
- Yeah� I'll be back.
- Okay.

865
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:17,524
Hey, Kirk.

866
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:18,955
I can't hear you! My eardrum popped!

867
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:21,838
Lorelai, if you see Luke, tell him that he and

868
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,057
he alone is responsible for all party cleanup.

869
00:37:24,058 --> 00:37:24,613
Okay.

870
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:26,931
Lorelai, you want to make a Morey sandwich?

871
00:37:26,932 --> 00:37:28,110
Maybe later, Babette.

872
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:41,119
- Hey.
- Hey.

873
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:45,341
Thank you.

874
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:48,553
Oh, it's...no big deal.

875
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,804
Luke

876
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,595
I just... like to see you happy.

877
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:33,976
Oh, honey, let me help you with that.

878
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,468
-I got it.
- Oh, no, I got it.

879
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:36,766
I know how to work a zipper, mom.

880
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:39,202
- Okay. That's it, huh?
- Yep.

881
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:40,987
- Got everything?
- I think so.

882
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:42,237
Oh, what about this?

883
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,116
That's for the plane.

884
00:38:43,117 --> 00:38:44,368
Oh, how about these?

885
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:46,909
Um, those are old and broken. I have new ones.

886
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:50,653
I just feel like I need more time.

887
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:51,421
I know.

888
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:54,280
I really just feel ambushed, you know?

889
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:56,253
I thought I had so much more...time.

890
00:38:56,254 --> 00:38:57,615
I thought I had all summer to impart

891
00:38:57,616 --> 00:38:59,426
my wisdom about work and life and your future,

892
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:01,141
and I feel like I had something to tell you.

893
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:03,808
Oh, on the bus, make sure you choose a good seat,

894
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,931
you know because people are creatures of habit,

895
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:07,836
and the seat you pick in the beginning could be your seat

896
00:39:07,837 --> 00:39:08,799
for the rest of the year.

897
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,237
You know. Get a window seat, honey,

898
00:39:10,238 --> 00:39:11,240
'cause there's so much to see.

899
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:12,422
And you might want to sit in the back,

900
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:15,400
because people there tend to be more chatty and

901
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:18,535
friendly and -- I don't know
what it is about the front of the bus,

902
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:21,821
you know but people there just tend
to be a little more bossy and uptight.

903
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:23,470
It's just been that way since first grade.

904
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:24,776
And, honey, I know what you're gonna say,

905
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:27,403
but just don't wear shorts, okay no matter how hot it is.

906
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:31,286
It's not professional, and all
that heat and those sticky vinyl seats

907
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:33,017
it'll be like ripping a band-aid off

908
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:34,268
your thigh every time you stand up.

909
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:36,196
-- Don't be too shy.

910
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:38,551
Don't be too forward, but don't be too shy,

911
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,221
'cause you make a lovely first impression,

912
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:43,076
but you really grow on people, too.

913
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:43,460
Mom.

914
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:44,254
You need ziplock bags.

915
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:45,773
You should have them all the time, they're so handy.

916
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:46,216
Mom.

917
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,742
And I'm gonna give you that orange sweater.

918
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:50,505
I know you've wanted it, and I'm
you know what finally gonna give it to you.

919
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:54,783
Mom�You've given me everything I need.

920
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:06,806
- Okay.
- Okay.

921
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:08,588
Shall we?

922
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:11,301
What's the rush? It's, like, 5:00 A.M.

923
00:40:12,374 --> 00:40:13,370
Got a stop to make.

924
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:28,186
Mmm. The coffee smells good.

925
00:40:28,187 --> 00:40:30,452
- Hello, old friend.
- How is it?

926
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:32,167
Your first pot is always your best.

927
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:32,693
Good.

928
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:33,868
Thanks for opening up the place

929
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:35,270
I got to take care of my best customers.

930
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:37,203
So, you guys know what you want?

931
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:39,375
Oh, hmm, I have no idea.

932
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:40,779
Looks like a delightful menu.

933
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,633
Oh, it does look delightful, charming.

934
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:43,828
Very charming, adorable fonts.

935
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:45,039
I wish there were pictures.

936
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:48,492
You know, I'm gonna need a minute. I can't decide.

937
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,703
Take all the time you need.

938
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:55,691
But could we get some eggs and bacon

939
00:40:55,692 --> 00:40:57,209
and hash browns to tide us over?

940
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,805
- Coming up.
- And pancakes?

941
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:01,208
Hey, I like your necklace.

942
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,163
- Oh, you do?
- It suits you.

943
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:07,450
Thanks. Hey you got to be careful when
you drink coffee on the bus, it's bumpy.

944
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:08,392
I can handle it.

945
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:09,981
I should have gotten you a sippy cup.

946
00:41:09,982 --> 00:41:11,356
Maybe I should get a flask.

947
00:41:11,357 --> 00:41:12,829
Do they make flasks for hot beverages?

948
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,179
Yeah they're called thermoses.

949
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,860
Right, I'll get you a thermos that says

950
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:19,386
"World's Greatest Reporter"
to match your cap.

951
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:23,104
Oh, yeah, I meant to tell you
that I left that cap at home.

952
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:23,744
What?

953
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:25,243
Well It wasn't very flattering.

954
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:28,000
Well how will people know
you're the world's greatest reporter?

955
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:30,038
I don't know.

956
00:41:30,804 --> 00:41:32,356
I guess they'll just have to read your stuff.

957
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,063
I guess so.
