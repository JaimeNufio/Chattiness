1
00:00:01,493 --> 00:00:02,721
Is she still asleep?

2
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:04,999
Yeah, so let's be super-quiet.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,563
Super-quiet, Davey!

4
00:00:06,564 --> 00:00:07,828
Super-quiet, son!

5
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:11,121
Like we're playing a game called
"let's be super-quiet,"

6
00:00:11,122 --> 00:00:14,261
and you win a prize if you're super-quiet!

7
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:16,287
A prize! Let's get him out the door!
Let's get him out the door!

8
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:18,968
Lunches! Come on, Davey. Ohh!

9
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:21,684
Come on. Let's get your lunch.

10
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:22,445
It's fun.

11
00:00:22,447 --> 00:00:24,644
Here you go. Go give it to daddy. Okay.

12
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:25,625
Come to daddy, son.

13
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:28,142
Shh!
We're still playing the "super-quiet" game!

14
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:30,301
So, did she say anything else
to you after I went to bed?

15
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:33,593
Not a word. We sat and we had tea,

16
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:35,940
but she was somewhere else the whole time.

17
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,844
Don't open the door, Davey. The door's loud.

18
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,632
Let daddy open the door!

19
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:40,834
I'm worried about her.

20
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:43,453
If she wanted to talk about whatever it is,
she would have talked.

21
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:47,441
I know what it is. It's Luke.
I just-- I don't know the specifics.

22
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:48,581
Let's go.

23
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,430
Be very quiet going out the door, Davey.

24
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:51,405
Super-quiet!

25
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:53,883
- You're gonna win the prize.
- It's gonna be a super-fun prize!

26
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:55,774
- Close the door for me?
- Got it.

27
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,003
Great job, son! High five!

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,053
- Morning, Taylor.
- Good morning. Some weather, huh?

29
00:01:58,054 --> 00:01:59,808
If you don't like it, just wait five minutes.

30
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,636
Top of the day to you, Mrs. Harris.
Say hi to Maurice for me.

31
00:02:02,637 --> 00:02:03,785
Will do!

32
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,269
# Her every wicked skill #

33
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,654
# To change a lot of weather #

34
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:16,486
# No room was spared #

35
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:19,421
# No mood, show no mercy #

36
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,889
# I was a tireless fool #

37
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,402
# I thought I could do better #

38
00:02:24,403 --> 00:02:29,229
# I left in flames of paper shade
hanging from a light #

39
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,905
# And when it came to the victories #

40
00:02:33,906 --> 00:02:39,473
# The genus names of all the flowers
that were feeding off of #

41
00:02:39,474 --> 00:02:42,478
# Her amazing glow #

42
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:47,985
# Her amazing glow #

43
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:51,027
Oh, that's another good one.

44
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:52,949
- No, it's not.
- Hold it.

45
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,365
Yo, Alfred Stieglitz, stop with the pictures.

46
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:57,844
I prefer Cartier-Bresson.

47
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,912
My eyes are pale-- very
sensitive to the light.

48
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,580
You only graduate from college once,

49
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,881
and I will document it to my heart's content,
and you can't stop me.

50
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:06,411
At least I'm clothed in these.

51
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:09,756
Oh, yes, those shower photos will fetch
me a bundle on the internet.

52
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:10,931
I don't even know why I'm doing this.

53
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:12,731
Why am I doing this whole cap-and-gown thing?

54
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:15,744
Because the graduation ceremony
is not only for the graduate.

55
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:17,993
It's for the loved ones, too.
We talked about this.

56
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:19,642
No, you talked, and I disagreed.

57
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,267
And then I ruled, and that's that.

58
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,211
I'm taking that Stalin biography
away from you.

59
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:24,708
Come on. I don't want to be late.

60
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:26,883
You do realize you're putting
yourself in the cross hairs.

61
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:27,570
Meaning?

62
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:29,677
There will be all manner of Huntzbergers
in the audience.

63
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:31,587
Oh, I can avoid people with the best of them.

64
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:33,619
I didn't say "people." I said "Huntzbergers."

65
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,532
Don't you worry your pretty little head
about this. I'll take care of myself.

66
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,051
I just want you to be fully prepped.

67
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,734
Oh-ho.
I have outdone myself photographically.

68
00:03:40,735 --> 00:03:42,072
Every one of these is a keeper.

69
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:44,902
Okay, that's a close-up of my naked butt.
That's not a keeper.

70
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:46,816
You're right. That's a screen saver.

71
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:52,951
The olfactory sense is the sense that most
strongly evokes memories of the past.

72
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:55,841
Well, screw the past.

73
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,420
# Genevieve wears Dior #

74
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,897
# Margaret wears Trésor #

75
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:11,256
# Mary Jo wears Lauren,
but you don't wear no perfume #

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,468
# Deborah wears Clinique #

77
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:16,991
# Maryanne wears Mystique #

78
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:21,267
# Judith wears Shalimar,
but you don't wear no perfume #

79
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,459
# That's why I want to spend
my life with you #

80
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:26,868
# That's why I want to spend
my life with you #

81
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:30,394
# That's why I want to spend
my life with you #

82
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:36,862
# No one likes talkin' to a drunk #

83
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:39,081
# Unless he's buyin' #

84
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,732
# Nobody says hello #

85
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:45,044
# When they're goodbye-in' #

86
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:47,492
# Unless they're Hawaiian #

87
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:49,845
Well, hey, there, Taylor.
Fancy seeing you here.

88
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,895
- I live here!
- Beautiful.

89
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:55,079
# Nobody eats eggs and bacon #

90
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,195
# When they're fryin' that'd just be dumb #

91
00:04:58,196 --> 00:04:59,583
# You'd probably burn your tongue #

92
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:03,026
# And nobody laughs at a clown #

93
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:05,447
# When he's cryin' #

94
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:07,753
# Boo-hoo #

95
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:11,188
Is everyone seeing what's going on out here?

96
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:15,169
Lucas, have you eyeballed the chicanery
that's taking place outside?

97
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,355
What? Eyed what?

98
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:18,608
Balled-- eyeballed these hooligans!

99
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,566
How interested do I look in
talking to you, Taylor?

100
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:21,421
Not very.

101
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,822
And this is the very peak of my interest.

102
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,974
My god, there's another one!

103
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,420
I have a theory, Taylor.

104
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:27,305
Let's hear it.

105
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:31,554
Our usual town troubadour-- he was discovered
last week on these very streets.

106
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:32,396
Discovered?

107
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:35,029
Some big-time music manager
was limo-ing through town,

108
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,746
and he caught one of the troubadour's songs,

109
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:39,677
gave him an opening slot
on Neil Young's tour.

110
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,777
- Who's Neil Young?
- One of the Monkees.

111
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:45,167
Anyway, I'm guessing when word hit the
east coast troubadour community,

112
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:48,295
every one of them thought to come to Stars
Hollow for their shot at the big time.

113
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:50,621
There's an east coast troubadour community?

114
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:53,569
Oh, yes, our wandering musical storytellers.

115
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,662
It's an honored American tradition
going back to the puritans.

116
00:05:56,663 --> 00:06:00,811
Gierke Schoonhoven delighted his fellow
pilgrims with his timely songs.

117
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:03,465
His most popular was "A beaver ate my thumb."

118
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,834
It was quite catchy.

119
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:08,845
I wonder if Neil still does "Last train
to Clarksville." I love that song.

120
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:15,616
# I drive an '89 Volvo #

121
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:18,561
# Have you seen it anywhere? #

122
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,479
# 'Cause I can't seem to find it #

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,391
# And no one seems to care #

124
00:06:24,392 --> 00:06:27,328
# I don't know how it happened #

125
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:30,272
# I've never lost a car #

126
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:36,040
# I might have to retrace my
steps back to the bar #

127
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,895
# I stepped into a puddle #

128
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:43,008
# I'm bleeding from the lip #

129
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,184
Excuse me, uh, bohemian people!

130
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,285
May I have your attention, please?

131
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:49,522
I'm kind of doing a song here.

132
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:50,779
It won't take long.

133
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,608
Please, people, your attention!

134
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:56,182
I would just like to say that there
is no bigger fan of music

135
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,783
than the man standing before you.

136
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:02,066
No memory is more precious to
me than the one of my father

137
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:06,963
taking me to the Hartford civic auditorium
to see the great Pat Boone.

138
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:10,944
But you, my friends,
do not have the talent of Pat Boone.

139
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:15,862
And if you insist on loitering and
playing your hippie doo-wop music

140
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:19,834
to the obvious detriment of the mercantile
interests of this town,

141
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:24,060
our authorities will forcibly remove you--

142
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:28,090
with water hoses and canine
units if necessary!

143
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:30,492
Thank you for your time, and, uh...

144
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:32,390
goodbye.

145
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:36,085
Can you say "BTK"?

146
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,854
Oh, shoot.

147
00:07:59,232 --> 00:08:00,319
You're grounded.

148
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,917
Ha. Sorry, mom.

149
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,465
Kimmy saw this guy at the mall
who was a total chachi,

150
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:07,450
and he bought us a slurpee,
and we totally lost track of time.

151
00:08:07,451 --> 00:08:09,294
I called you twice. I left messages.

152
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:12,488
I called the national guard, who didn't
answer because they're all in Baghdad.

153
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:14,035
Well, I just checked my messages.

154
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,149
I won't be ignored, Dan.

155
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,430
I know. I'm hiding my rabbit as we speak.

156
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:19,181
So what's the deal?

157
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:22,208
No deal. I, um,
spent the night at Sookie's last night.

158
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:22,653
Why?

159
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:24,626
No reason. We were talking and it got late,

160
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,932
so I crashed on her couch and
woke up covered in jam.

161
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:27,967
Is everything all right?

162
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,827
Everything's fine.

163
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:31,101
How's it going with you?

164
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:32,788
Well, Logan graduated.

165
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,404
Oh, that's right-- the graduation. Wow.
How was it?

166
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:37,570
I'm here now. It was nice.

167
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:41,339
Logan looked great-- very dignified.
He didn't trip. He remembered to wear pants.

168
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,665
He's quite a catch, that guy.

169
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,121
I was very proud of him.

170
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:47,217
I'm just waiting for him to extricate
himself from those people.

171
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:48,588
Oh, his parents are there, huh?

172
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:51,653
Yep, they are with Logan,
and I am standing a good 50 feet away.

173
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:52,994
As per the restraining order.

174
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:55,092
They're dragging him out for drinks,
30 minutes top,

175
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:57,970
we're meeting back at the apartment,
and then he'll be all mine.

176
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,398
I've got the afternoon planned out.

177
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:02,171
Oh, you're such a girlfriend.
You should take him to the mall.

178
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:03,266
I'll think about it.

179
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:04,427
So, you take pictures?

180
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:06,914
Only about a thousand.
I'll bring my camera tonight.

181
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:09,531
Oh, listen, just a heads-up--

182
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,405
I might have to duck out after drinks.

183
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,594
No! Why?

184
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,703
I made reservations at this really
crappy Italian restaurant

185
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,686
with Chianti bottles hanging
from the ceiling,

186
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,219
and the husband and wife that own the place

187
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,021
wind up screaming at each other
after 8:00-- we love it.

188
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,137
Sounds great.

189
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:26,210
Well, it's our last night together for a
while. I want it to be really special.

190
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:27,547
Sounds perfect.

191
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:29,257
Okay, I better get back.
I'll see you tonight?

192
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:31,203
Okay, hon. See you tonight.

193
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:39,412
Hello! Babette!

194
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:44,671
Hi, buddy. Where's Babette?

195
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,327
Oh, she had to go, honey.

196
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,539
I told her I'd take the morning shift.

197
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,511
She told me to tell you that
everything went fine.

198
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:52,285
Paul Anka ate all his food,

199
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:54,461
and then he did something weird
with your nightgown.

200
00:09:54,462 --> 00:09:56,239
Oh, are you cross-dressing again?

201
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,543
I got here at 7:30.
I gave him a little kibble and a new hoof,

202
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:03,388
and he ran around the house a few times
and then passed out in the corner.

203
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:04,805
He's been quiet ever since.

204
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:06,266
Thank you guys for doing this, Patty.

205
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:09,002
Paul Anka's never spent the
whole night alone before.

206
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:11,286
Oh, it's our pleasure, sweetheart.

207
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:14,396
So, you're staying out all night, huh?
Anything illegal?

208
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:16,713
Oh, no, no. Just a little girls' night out.

209
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:19,856
Or in, I should say.
Sookie and I had a slumber party.

210
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:21,016
Oh, that sounds fun.

211
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:22,260
Do you want some coffee, Patty?

212
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,806
Oh, no, sweetheart. I need to get going.

213
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:27,760
I'm teaching a cardio striptease
class at 10:00.

214
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:30,258
I have to make sure those poles
are screwed in tight.

215
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,289
Okay.

216
00:10:32,335 --> 00:10:33,589
Lorelai, you here?

217
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,651
Tell him I'm not here.

218
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:35,715
- What?
- Patty, please.

219
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:36,717
- Tell him I'm not here.
- Lorelai?

220
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:38,018
No, no, but I--

221
00:10:38,776 --> 00:10:40,068
Luke, hi.

222
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,037
What the hell are you doing here?

223
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:42,857
Oh, if I had a nickel for
every time I heard that.

224
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,984
- I'm looking for Lorelai.
- Well, she's not here.

225
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:46,056
Her jeep's right out front.

226
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:48,807
Well, all I know is that she called
to have me come and feed Paul Anka.

227
00:10:48,808 --> 00:10:49,373
Called from where?

228
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:51,282
I don't know. The Inn, maybe.

229
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,894
No, she's not at the Inn. I tried the Inn.

230
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,950
Well, uh, I-I don't know.

231
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:58,624
You know, half the time people speak to me,
I'm thinking about Baryshnikov.

232
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,622
- Did you see "Turning point"?
- No.

233
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:03,855
- Oh, that man was so beautiful.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

234
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:05,824
Pure sex walking.

235
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,428
Flying, actually. That man could fly.

236
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:10,580
Have you ever thought of taking dance?

237
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:11,726
Me? No.

238
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:14,003
Well, maybe you might want to think about it.

239
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:16,269
There's nothing sexier than a man in tights.

240
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,557
Yeah, I'm sure that's true.

241
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:19,405
Look, can you just tell Lorelai I came by?

242
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,895
Oh, of course I will, honey.

243
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:23,316
Thanks. Stop imagining me in tights, Patty.

244
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:25,275
It's a free country, honey.

245
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:33,426
- He is so easy.
- Thank you, Patty.

246
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:35,215
Something going on with you and Luke?

247
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:38,244
It's nothing.
We had a little fight-- nothing big.
I'm just...

248
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:40,596
Punishing him. Good for you.

249
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:42,558
The longer the freeze-out,
the better the makeup.

250
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,747
Yes, exactly.

251
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,307
Listen, thank you for doing this.

252
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:49,122
Oh, sure, any time.
If you need anything else,
just give me a call.

253
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:49,755
I will.

254
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:52,542
Oh, and, honey,
don't freeze him out too long.

255
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:55,674
Luke is a much better man
than my first husband...

256
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:57,260
or second husband.

257
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,745
But he's neck and neck with
the third one, though.

258
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:00,740
Okay.

259
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:05,005
Bye, Paul Anka! Thank you for letting
me scratch your butt for an hour!

260
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,958
Just like husband number four.

261
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:09,389
Bye.

262
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:20,635
Pete Michaels will be there for
at least the first two months.

263
00:12:20,636 --> 00:12:23,440
He runs the department,
so he's the one to see.

264
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:26,341
He's a good guy. I got to go.

265
00:12:26,342 --> 00:12:27,758
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

266
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:28,582
Yeah.

267
00:12:29,478 --> 00:12:30,360
Yeah?

268
00:12:30,361 --> 00:12:31,652
- Hey.
- What happened?

269
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:32,970
It took longer than I thought.

270
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:36,045
Way longer. And I've got to leave for
my grandparents' like right now.

271
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,673
To top it of,
just as the family thing is winding down,

272
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,993
a bunch of dad's business automatons came by,
and he made me stay to talk shop.

273
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:42,846
To talk shop?

274
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:46,333
Synergy and new media ventures in
increasing shareholder value.

275
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:47,579
I could hear my soul dying.

276
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,721
- He's doing this on purpose.
- I wouldn't put it past him.

277
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:50,881
Why is he doing this?

278
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:53,753
Look, don't think about him. Just go.
Go to your thing.

279
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:55,547
Get it over with. I'll wait for you here. Go.

280
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:56,070
Okay.

281
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:56,927
No more thoughts about Mitchum.

282
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:59,161
- You're right. No more thoughts.
- Go.

283
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,178
Yeah. At this number.

284
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:07,452
Here, call me back. Bye.

285
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:16,750
Oh. Hello, Rory.

286
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,512
Were you at the ceremony? We didn't see you.

287
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:24,197
Yeah, I was there.

288
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,225
We didn't see you.

289
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:27,588
Well, I was there.

290
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:31,535
Did you know that Logan and I had plans
to go out after the ceremony?

291
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:33,015
I mean, were you aware of that?

292
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:35,185
- No, I was not.
- Yeah.

293
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:37,497
'Cause why would your son want
to go out with his girlfriend

294
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:40,428
- the last day before he leaves, right?
- Rory--

295
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:44,602
And this gathering of yours-- it turns into
a business meeting on his graduation day?

296
00:13:44,603 --> 00:13:47,025
As if Logan's not gonna have enough
time for that during the year

297
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,896
you're forcing him to do in London.

298
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,824
It wasn't exactly a business meeting.

299
00:13:50,825 --> 00:13:52,425
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

300
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:54,230
Why are you taking him away from me. Why?

301
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:55,626
Do you hate me that much?

302
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,287
- I don't hate you.
- Yeah, right.

303
00:13:57,288 --> 00:13:58,491
Why would I hate you?

304
00:13:58,492 --> 00:13:59,694
Because I'm dating your son.

305
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:02,264
Logan's love life is his business.
I don't get involved.

306
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:05,256
Oh, please.
You have done nothing but get involved.

307
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:06,069
How?

308
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,847
You're sending him away-- 5,000 miles away.

309
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,824
What other reason is there
but to separate us?

310
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,840
Well, you flatter yourself if you
think I put that much energy

311
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:14,490
into thinking about your relationship.

312
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:15,352
Here's the lobby.

313
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:18,618
Wait. Let's get this clear right now.
I'm sending Logan away for one reason--

314
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:23,310
because it is time. It is time for him to
stop jumping out of planes in a gorilla mask

315
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:27,239
and crashing boats and getting plastered
every night and ending up in the hospital.

316
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,308
It's time for him to stop being a
child and to start being a man.

317
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,707
It's time for him to start
focusing on his future,

318
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,737
and the only way he is gonna do that
is to get him out of his environment

319
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:38,068
and away from those dopes, Colin and Finn,

320
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:41,583
and the Life and Death Brigade
and get him on a path.

321
00:14:41,584 --> 00:14:43,640
Logan is talented. He's talented.
He's my son.

322
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:46,323
I want him to achieve something.
And he needs a push.

323
00:14:47,326 --> 00:14:48,972
It's what my father did with me.

324
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:52,149
He pushed me, I grew up,
and now Logan is gonna grow up.

325
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,460
Anything here you're not agreeing with?

326
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,785
I didn't think so.

327
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,819
# And we tried #

328
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:15,843
# We tried with all our might #

329
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:21,267
# We tore the playhouse down #

330
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,312
# We ran #

331
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,497
# Headlong in our way #

332
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,814
# Yeah, we tried so hard #

333
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:42,519
# We stared at the sun too long #

334
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,918
Got your mail here, Taylor.

335
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,199
Thanks, Cliff.

336
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,092
I guess the last group of miscreants
didn't get word

337
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:52,717
that troubadours are persona
non grata in Stars Hollow.

338
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,114
Just one more rat I have to exterminate.

339
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:57,592
See ya, Cliff.

340
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,083
Gerta, you're half my age.
Why do I always beat you to the door?

341
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:29,878
- Hi, mom.
- Hello, Lorelai.

342
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:31,716
So, just you tonight?

343
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:35,077
Well, I know how mad you when I bring
the insane clown posse with me.

344
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,172
So no Luke?

345
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,076
- Luke's working.
- All right.

346
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:39,213
So, how are we?

347
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:40,684
We're good. Fine.

348
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:42,395
We're starving. We'd love a drink.

349
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:44,520
Your father's making martinis
in the living room.

350
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,330
Oh, now your legs work.

351
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:47,453
Here, hang these up.

352
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:49,458
And eat something with sugar!

353
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:51,314
That's it. I'll take care of the rest.

354
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:55,828
Just say whatever it takes and get him out
of there about 9:30. I trust you, Finn.

355
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,493
No, it's not a surprise you've never
heard anyone say that before.

356
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:01,349
Just get Colin and get him out of there. Bye.

357
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,208
Sorry, everyone. I'm off it for good now.

358
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:04,656
- Hello, Lorelai.
- Thanks, dad.

359
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,036
- Hello. What's this?
- Don't touch that!

360
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:08,253
He slapped my hand earlier.

361
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:09,651
It is top secret.

362
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:11,805
Oh, my god.
It's the weapons of mass destruction.

363
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:13,238
Quick-- get the president on the phone.

364
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:13,935
Lorelai...

365
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,109
If he's not in the oval office,
try the ice-cream room.

366
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,144
Just tell them what it is, Richard.

367
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:21,963
Well, it looks like we're going to
receive a tidy little settlement

368
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:24,519
from the charlatan that botched
your mother's eye surgery.

369
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,301
A very tidy settlement.

370
00:17:26,302 --> 00:17:29,218
And we've decided to add it to the
money we're donating to Yale.

371
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:32,367
Oh, thank god.
Finally a hot meal for the lacrosse team.

372
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:35,013
We're adding it to the money we're
donating in Rory's name.

373
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:36,533
Oh, goody. They didn't forget.

374
00:17:36,534 --> 00:17:38,606
And with that extra money, we can now afford

375
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:41,193
what is on the table right in front of you.

376
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,868
Richard, do the honors.

377
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:43,898
All right.

378
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:46,736
Miss Rory Gilmore, may I present...

379
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:48,973
your building.

380
00:17:48,974 --> 00:17:49,720
What?!

381
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:50,916
Your science building.

382
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:54,460
On the Q.T., a friend of mine who knows
the architect snagged the model for me.

383
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:57,072
It's a beauty, isn't it?
Built perfectly to scale.

384
00:17:57,073 --> 00:18:00,335
Very sleek. And there's plenty of
wall space inside for a portrait.

385
00:18:00,337 --> 00:18:01,157
Of who?

386
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:02,033
Of you.

387
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:03,288
And look right here.

388
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,544
My friend attached a placard to
the front of the building.

389
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:07,804
The Rory Gilmore astronomy building.

390
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,004
Um, grandpa--

391
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,851
They're going to start construction
this summer,

392
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,563
so it should be up and running by Christmas.

393
00:18:12,564 --> 00:18:14,590
Is this the actual lettering?

394
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:15,906
I mean, is this the scale?

395
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:16,901
I don't know.

396
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:19,003
Although the style is very dignified.

397
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:21,489
I'm sure we can request this
lettering if you like.

398
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,067
It's your building, so why not?

399
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,167
Because the lettering would be 30 feet high.

400
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:28,435
Well, honey, it's the astronomy building.
You have to be able to see it from space.

401
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:30,165
I don't know whether it's to scale.

402
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,990
Is there someone we can call to check?

403
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:34,444
Relax, Rory. She's so modest.

404
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:38,506
Relax, Rory. Remember when you wanted
a personalized license plate?

405
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:39,672
So much better.

406
00:18:39,673 --> 00:18:41,408
We're going to try to get
them to add another floor

407
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:43,634
so that it's taller than
everything around it.

408
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:45,304
Make it stand out a bit more.

409
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:46,132
More than this?!

410
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,670
I love the portrait idea.

411
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,983
Who's not helping?

412
00:18:48,984 --> 00:18:51,755
Excuse me, everyone.
Christopher Hayden has arrived.

413
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,476
Christopher, how wonderful. Come in. Come in.

414
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,467
- W-what are you doing here?
- I was invited.

415
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,143
Shut up! Me too!

416
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:00,575
We promised Christopher a homecooked
meal last time we saw him,

417
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:03,822
and since we're leaving for Europe
for the next two months,

418
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:06,257
this was the last chance we had
to make good on that promise.

419
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:09,460
You can call a Gilmore many things,
but you can't call him a welsher.

420
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:12,065
What are the things you can call him,
just for future reference?

421
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,961
I'm very grateful for the invitation, Emily.

422
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:15,951
- Martini, Christopher?
- Sounds good.

423
00:19:15,952 --> 00:19:17,012
What's this?

424
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:19,128
- It's Rory's building.
- It's not my building.

425
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:21,327
It's got your name on it.
Wow, are those letters to scale?

426
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,319
- Oh, boy.
- 'Cause it's gonna be huge.

427
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,116
Yeah. Okay, dad, you can take my seat

428
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:29,194
because I have to go legally change
my name and transfer to Brown.

429
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:32,553
Honey, now come on. We have teased
you way worse than this before.

430
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:35,900
Remember when you were 10 and
thought you discovered U2?

431
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:37,998
I should get going.
Logan's leaving in the morning.

432
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,281
Oh, that's right.
Tell him to have a safe trip.

433
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,610
I will.

434
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,533
My goodness.
It's grand central station here tonight.

435
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,516
Come on, Rory. I'll walk you out.

436
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,037
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

437
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:50,049
- Christopher.
- Thank you.

438
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,500
So, he's leaving, huh?

439
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:53,432
Yeah, he's going to London
to work for his dad.

440
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,040
She should be very proud of that boy.

441
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,673
She should.
She should buy him an observatory.

442
00:19:57,674 --> 00:19:59,581
Well, look who I found outside.

443
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:00,828
Oh. Carolyn.

444
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:03,087
Hello, Richard. How wonderful to see you,

445
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:05,096
especially standing so close to a martini.

446
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:07,850
Oh, Carolyn, that sense of humor of yours.

447
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,648
One martini coming right up.

448
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,990
Carolyn, this is my daughter, Lorelai.

449
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:15,174
Lorelai, this is Carolyn Bates-- "Lynnie"
to those in the know.

450
00:20:15,175 --> 00:20:17,279
- Oh, am I in the know?
- You are now.

451
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,604
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

452
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:20,670
And, Lynnie, this is Christopher Hayden.

453
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:21,417
Nice to meet you.

454
00:20:21,418 --> 00:20:23,310
Lynnie, olives or a twist?

455
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:24,402
Olives, please.

456
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:27,429
Lynnie's mother and I go so far back,
I'm embarrassed to talk about it.

457
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,118
Lorelai, you remember my talking
about Marie Randle.

458
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,606
We were roommates in college.

459
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:35,226
Well, Lynnie is her daughter,
and she just moved to Hartford,

460
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:37,184
so, of course, we promised her a dinner.

461
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,529
And since we're going to be out of town
for the next couple of months,

462
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,473
tonight seemed like the perfect opportunity.

463
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,039
Tonight she's settling up all old debts, huh?

464
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,787
Lynnie, I've got your two olives.

465
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:47,648
Thank you very much, Richard.

466
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,224
- Move.
- What?

467
00:20:49,225 --> 00:20:50,215
- Move.
- Ow!

468
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,356
Mom, the arm is supposed to be connected
to the rest of the body!

469
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:55,354
Lynnie, you come sit down next to
Christopher. Lorelai's gonna sit with me.

470
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,219
Okay.

471
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,099
You know, Lynnie is a psychologist.
Isn't that fascinating?

472
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,023
I do a lot of work with family
counseling-- runaways and drug recovery.

473
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:05,300
Arm-yanking rehab. Ow!

474
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:07,997
Lynnie just moved here from Maine.
Isn't that interesting?

475
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:10,461
I've never been to Maine.
Christopher, have you ever been to Maine?

476
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:12,552
Uh, no, but I like lobster.

477
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:14,196
Well, then, you're in.

478
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:18,776
I tell you, Lynnie, you're a card,
just like your mother.

479
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,028
Christopher, you should meet her mother.
She's a stitch.

480
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,895
Isn't Lynnie's mother a stitch, Richard?

481
00:21:22,896 --> 00:21:25,073
She's an entire seam, Emily.

482
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:27,990
It's so important to find someone
who can make you laugh.

483
00:21:27,991 --> 00:21:30,774
I was always so envious of
Johnny Carson's wives.

484
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:34,610
I just thought these women must do
nothing but laugh all the time.

485
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:35,884
How's your drink, Lynnie?

486
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:38,036
Very potent. Thank you, Emily.

487
00:21:38,037 --> 00:21:40,546
Well, potent is good because
tonight is a party.

488
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:41,741
Which reminds me--

489
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:46,222
Christopher, Lynnie once threw her mother
the most wonderful birthday party.

490
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:48,884
I think she made the cake herself,
didn't you, Lynnie?

491
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:53,250
Oh, these days a woman who can bake
is a rare treasure, isn't she?

492
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:55,117
And Lynnie is a Leo.

493
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:05,299
# Give me hollow stimulation #

494
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,566
# It's so sleazy to be free #

495
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:12,094
# Lots of lust in all creation #

496
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:15,271
# This silly cheap legacy #

497
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:17,570
# What a waste #

498
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,950
# You're so chaste #

499
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,066
# I can't wait #

500
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,626
# To taste your face #

501
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:31,114
Stop! Oh-ho!

502
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:34,854
This is private property.
Stop that jumping right now!

503
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,832
There's no jumping in the town square!

504
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:42,295
Officer Ruskin, what took you so long?
I called you hours ago.

505
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:43,836
Well, I'm here now, Taylor. What do you need?

506
00:22:43,837 --> 00:22:45,934
Handcuff these ruffians and take them away.

507
00:22:45,935 --> 00:22:46,736
In what?

508
00:22:46,737 --> 00:22:47,788
In your car.

509
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:49,208
Well, I came on my bike.

510
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,181
Why?

511
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:52,462
Fred took the car.
Plus my handcuffs are broken.

512
00:22:52,463 --> 00:22:57,054
Well, then, find an appropriate
vehicle to haul them away.

513
00:22:57,055 --> 00:22:59,977
My sister has an S.U.V..
But she's out of town, though.

514
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,530
Well, then, line them up and have
them follow you to jail.

515
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,652
I could do that,
but it's a single cell, though.

516
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:06,665
It holds two-- maybe three
if they're not fat.

517
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,608
And we don't have any food.

518
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:09,341
Oh, forget it... Barney Fife.

519
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:10,801
My brother has a pinto.

520
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:12,360
Patty, don't do that.

521
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,316
But they're hungry.

522
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:15,498
If you feed them, they won't go away.

523
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:16,748
Taylor!

524
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:19,658
How'd you let this happen?
This is my turf, Taylor!

525
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,298
How did I let this happen?
This is your fault.

526
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:24,680
You had to go off and make
it in the big time,

527
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,213
and now they're all copying you.

528
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:29,167
The big time? I made 700 bucks and got booed.

529
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:31,000
And I never even met Neil Young.

530
00:23:31,001 --> 00:23:32,951
Heart of gold, my ass.

531
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:35,447
I suddenly feel very tired.

532
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,740
Would you like a tiramisu?

533
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:39,261
No, I think I'd just like to go to bed.

534
00:23:39,262 --> 00:23:41,915
Tell everybody to try and keep it down.

535
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:44,418
God, I hate music.

536
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:47,946
# A beaver ate my thumb #

537
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:50,628
# A beaver ate my thumb #

538
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,213
# A doctor gave me rum #

539
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,655
# 'Cause a beaver ate my thumb #

540
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,654
- How old?
- 4 going on 40.

541
00:23:58,655 --> 00:24:00,852
And a doll-- a living doll.

542
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:04,181
Enjoy them while their legs are still short
enough for you to overtake them.

543
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:05,556
That's good advice, doc, thanks.

544
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:07,227
Excuse me. I'm just gonna go to the restroom.

545
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:08,819
Well, hurry back. Dinner's almost on.

546
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,907
Yes, ma'am.

547
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,207
My sister just had twins last week.

548
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,158
Twins? Wow, that sounds--

549
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,375
- Loud?
- Exactly.

550
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:19,131
I'm sorry-- I know I'm being very forward,

551
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:23,088
but the picture of the two of you sitting
there so young, so beautiful--

552
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:25,962
it's almost like looking at a shampoo ad.

553
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,860
Oh, my god. What are you doing?

554
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:31,306
What do you mean what am I doing?

555
00:24:31,307 --> 00:24:32,915
I thought "restroom" was code for "follow me,

556
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,854
and we'll talk about how
to get you out of this."

557
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,544
What the hell kind of spy
school did you go to?

558
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:39,529
Oh, I'm here now, so let's figure
out how to get me out of this.

559
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,349
Out of what?

560
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,621
What do you mean, out of what?
This is a setup.

561
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:43,545
So it seems.

562
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,224
I can't believe Emily would do this.

563
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:46,757
You're talking about Emily Dickinson, right?

564
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:48,458
'Cause Emily Gilmore was made to do this.

565
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,319
I thought I was having dinner
with you and Rory.

566
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,037
I didn't realize I was going on a date.

567
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:53,909
Well, luckily you didn't get ugly overnight.

568
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,727
- Thanks a lot, by the way.
- What did I do?

569
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:58,428
Nothing! You're sitting there,
you not saying anything.

570
00:24:58,429 --> 00:24:59,829
What are you talking about?

571
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,237
When mom said, "doesn't he look like
Cary Grant?" I said, "yes."

572
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:05,636
- You're just letting this happen.
- I’m not just letting this happen.

573
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,254
You can't see that I'm miserable out there?

574
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,614
No, I can't. You seem fine.
You're talking to her.

575
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:11,984
She’s talking to me. What am I supposed
to do-- slap her in the mouth?

576
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:13,226
That would be a conversation stopper.

577
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:16,146
I assumed at some point you'd
jump in and try and save me.

578
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,391
- By doing what?
- I don't know--

579
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:20,694
deflect, detract,
get the conversation off her and me and us.

580
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:22,518
I'm sorry. I didn't know you needed saving.

581
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,116
- Oh, come on.
- "Oh, come on"?

582
00:25:25,117 --> 00:25:27,635
How do I know you don't want to date her?
You're single. She's single.

583
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:30,911
You're pretty. She's pretty.
It's how all great divorces start.

584
00:25:30,912 --> 00:25:32,573
How did I used to get out of here?

585
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,302
- What are you talking about?
- In high school, I'd be in your room.

586
00:25:34,303 --> 00:25:36,094
I had several ways of sneaking out of here.

587
00:25:36,095 --> 00:25:36,873
Chris!

588
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:39,125
Which drainpipe was it that
I used to crawl down?

589
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:41,193
- Christopher! - I think he used to
get to it from the attic windows.

590
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:44,094
Does the attic window still access the
drainpipe that drops you off by the garage?

591
00:25:44,095 --> 00:25:46,070
You do know you're grown up now.

592
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:47,791
You can just walk out the front door.

593
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,658
If I just leave, I'll insult your parents.

594
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:51,955
But vanishing into thin
air-- way more polite.

595
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:56,421
It's only 8:00!
This night's gonna last forever.
We haven't even had dinner yet.

596
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,432
Relax. Now that I know you're
not interested in her--

597
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,447
- I'm not!
- Okay.

598
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:03,494
Now that I know, I can help you out.

599
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,193
- You will?
- Yeah, I got your back.

600
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,695
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

601
00:26:08,696 --> 00:26:11,099
- I know you always got mine.
- Always.

602
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:14,435
So, it wasn't code, you know. I got to...

603
00:26:14,436 --> 00:26:16,461
Yes, right.
I'll see you back in the living room.

604
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:17,321
Yeah.

605
00:26:22,265 --> 00:26:23,854
Very interesting dinner, Emily.

606
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:28,573
It's paella.
I got the recipe from Hilde Maclntosh,
whose son married a Spanish girl.

607
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:32,099
God knows how long it's going to last,
but the food at their wedding was wonderful.

608
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,548
- Do you like it, Lynnie?
- I do.

609
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:35,465
- Not too spicy?
- I like spicy food.

610
00:26:35,466 --> 00:26:36,545
Do you?

611
00:26:36,546 --> 00:26:38,330
Well, Christopher, did you hear that?

612
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,181
Lynnie likes spicy food, and so do you.
Isn't that something?

613
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,513
Uh, yes. Small world.

614
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:47,082
Hey, Lynnie, I have a recurring dream
where a walrus waddles up,

615
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,218
lies down on me, falls asleep,
and I can't breathe.

616
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:50,825
- What do you think it means?
- Lorelai...

617
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:52,992
What, dad? Lynnie is a psychologist.
She should know.

618
00:26:52,993 --> 00:26:54,312
It's okay.

619
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,967
It could mean a myriad of things--

620
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:59,218
too much stress at work,
something in your life is strangling you,

621
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,868
you've read "Alice in Wonderland"
too many times.

622
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,725
Touché, Lynnie.

623
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:03,482
She's got wit and wisdom, this one.

624
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:07,685
You know, Christopher does the Sunday New
York Times puzzle every single week.

625
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:10,227
Hey, what's it called when
you're afraid of spiders?

626
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,307
Arachnophobia.

627
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:12,833
- You have arachnophobia?
- No.

628
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:13,728
My goodness.

629
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:16,406
What's it called when you're afraid of people
who are afraid of spiders?
'Cause that one I've got.

630
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:17,400
Oh, lord.

631
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:20,213
I don't think there's a technical
term for that yet.

632
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:23,175
How about arachnophobiaphobia?
'Cause that makes sense.

633
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:25,004
You know, Christopher, Lynnie--

634
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:26,791
Voices in your head-- totally normal, right?

635
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:29,378
- Excuse me?
- There's only two... that speak English.

636
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,731
Lorelai, eat your paella.

637
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,905
So, Christopher, how's business going?

638
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:34,428
It's really been picking up lately.

639
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:35,369
What do you do?

640
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,144
Oh, I'm in computer software.

641
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:38,221
That sounds exciting.

642
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,083
It can be. It's a lot of traveling, actually.

643
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:42,555
I love traveling.
It's one thing I really miss about my job.

644
00:27:42,556 --> 00:27:44,653
You know what I think is even
better than traveling?

645
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:47,269
Time-traveling. Do you think that's possible?

646
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,669
I would have no idea.

647
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,463
Lorelai, are you having
some kind of breakdown?

648
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:51,898
You're very quiet, Christopher.

649
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:52,972
Well, I, uh--

650
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:56,077
Lynnie, as a psychologist,
tell me what do you think of "The Sopranos"?

651
00:27:56,078 --> 00:27:57,525
Actually, I miss Adriana.

652
00:27:57,526 --> 00:27:59,372
- Oh, so do I.
- Lorelai!

653
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:01,014
What? I was serious about that one.

654
00:28:01,015 --> 00:28:03,421
That's it. No more talk until dessert.

655
00:28:07,662 --> 00:28:09,391
- Come on! One more stop!
- I can't.

656
00:28:09,392 --> 00:28:12,246
But tomorrow you'll fly away to London,
and we will forget all about you.

657
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,178
I'm touched,
but Rory will be back in a minute.

658
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,655
You know, I'm starting to get the feeling
you'd rather be with her than with us.

659
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:17,483
Impossible.

660
00:28:17,484 --> 00:28:19,286
I appreciate the drinks and the diversion.

661
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,930
Your friendship over the years is worth
at least a couple pages in my memoir.

662
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:23,578
But as of now, it's goodbye.

663
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,129
I'm spending the rest of the
night alone with my girl.

664
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:28,589
Hello, governor. Chips?

665
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,367
I'm sorry. I was looking for my girlfriend.

666
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:32,352
Oh, I'm sorry, mate. No girlfriends here.

667
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:35,264
Just us birds and blokes taking
the piss out of each other.

668
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:36,722
Your accent is terrible, by the way.

669
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:38,341
Just go with it, you geezer.

670
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:42,220
Now we have heard that you're about
to fly away to old blighty,

671
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,456
and word 'round the pub has it
you're not happy about it.

672
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,895
Well, I'm leaving a couple people
I'm pretty fond of...

673
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:50,777
and some people I'm a little afraid of,
but all in all...

674
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:53,869
Well, we're just going to have to change
your mind, because London, you see,

675
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,631
is a place of fun and musical excitement,
the queen, Hello! Magazine.

676
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:01,129
You're gonna break into a chorus of "chim
chimney" any minute, aren't you?

677
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,691
Shush, now. None of that talk.

678
00:29:02,692 --> 00:29:05,245
Because tomorrow,
brilliant things will happen--

679
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:06,937
a new life, a new adventure.

680
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:08,529
You like adventure, don't you, mate?

681
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,506
Well, London is certainly the place for that,

682
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:13,825
and we, frankly,
would not be the fine chaps we claim to be

683
00:29:13,826 --> 00:29:16,303
if we did not send you off in a proper way--

684
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:18,547
with the bash of a lifetime!

685
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:22,005
Come on. Someone get this chap a pint.

686
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:24,057
See, if you can't be happy,
at least you can be drunk.

687
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:25,157
Kiss me, Mary Poppins.

688
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:27,175
I thought it was more Gwyneth Paltrow,
"Shakespeare in love."

689
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:27,998
Kiss me.

690
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,058
- To the queen!
- To the queen!

691
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:36,156
Well, that was a complete waste of time.

692
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:37,112
What are you talking about?

693
00:29:37,113 --> 00:29:39,681
I'm talking about Christopher and
Carolyn leaving separately.

694
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:41,948
Well, come on, mom. What did you think?

695
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,877
They were gonna throw down and consummate
it right here in the foyer?

696
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:47,964
No, I didn't think they were gonna throw
down and consummate it in the foyer.

697
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:49,527
I just thought they could go out for coffee.

698
00:29:49,528 --> 00:29:51,022
- You served them coffee.
- So what?

699
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,130
So you can't be shocked when you
serve people 3 cups of coffee,

700
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:55,266
and they don't feel like going out
for coffee. Not everyone is me.

701
00:29:55,267 --> 00:29:57,360
I just thought they would have
hit it off better than that.

702
00:29:57,361 --> 00:29:58,770
You never know with these things.

703
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:00,354
I was just so sure.

704
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,714
Oh, well. Maybe next time.

705
00:30:01,715 --> 00:30:02,565
Absolutely.

706
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:04,889
Christopher's probably too immature
for Lynnie, anyway.

707
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,880
I'm sure he is.

708
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:09,213
The way he was going on and on
about that motorcycle of his.

709
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:11,628
I half expected him to start talking
about his tonka truck

710
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:15,022
and announcing to the room he wanted
to be a fireman or a cowboy someday.

711
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,705
Sure is nice when it's not me.

712
00:30:16,706 --> 00:30:19,193
All right, bye, mom. Have a nice trip.

713
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,037
Goodbye, Lorelai.

714
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,696
Gerta, did I fire you?

715
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:27,814
No.

716
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:29,271
Really?

717
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:30,867
Everything's off tonight.

718
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:35,203
You also know that it is one meal,
and one meal does not a lifestyle make.

719
00:30:35,204 --> 00:30:36,707
That's okay, Sandra.

720
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:40,010
All right. Okay. Call anytime.
I'll talk to you on Monday.

721
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:41,662
Sorry. I'm blocking you in.

722
00:30:41,663 --> 00:30:43,130
No, no, that's okay.

723
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:44,658
So, you do sessions over the phone?

724
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,666
I do sessions whenever people need them.

725
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,220
Wow. That's quite a commitment.

726
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,875
Well, I've always been a good listener.

727
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:51,209
Excellent note-taker.

728
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,341
I have fantastic penmanship.

729
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:54,966
Good head-nodding abilities.

730
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,418
You found your calling.

731
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:57,930
I think I did.

732
00:30:58,603 --> 00:30:59,783
So, it was nice meeting you.

733
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:03,416
Oh, you too. You too.
This was really very sweet of your mom.

734
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:04,934
Well, you keep thinking that.

735
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:08,395
Hey, it's been a long time since I've
been invited to such a blatant setup.

736
00:31:08,396 --> 00:31:10,155
It made me miss my own mom.

737
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:12,435
Oh, I'll just let it go to voice mail.

738
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:14,428
Your work sure follows you around, huh?

739
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:17,510
When you're going through something, you
never know when you're gonna need to talk.

740
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:19,303
Sometimes it sneaks up on you.

741
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:21,120
Yeah, I suppose so.

742
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:25,011
- You okay?
- Me? Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

743
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:26,379
It was really nice meeting you.

744
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,170
Sorry if I talked too much during dinner.

745
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:30,909
Every now and then,
I just feel the need to re-enact

746
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,483
certain key scenes from "Purple rain,"
you know, for a captive audience.

747
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:36,846
The Lake Minnetonka scene
really bugs my mom, so...

748
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:38,801
I could analyze that one for you if you want.

749
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:42,744
That one, I've got a handle on.
Other things are more fuzzy, but that one,
I got.

750
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:44,235
Okay.

751
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,428
- Lorelai?
- Yeah?

752
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:52,493
Do you...
do you want to talk about something?

753
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,267
Me? No, no, I'm good.

754
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,905
It was nice meeting you. Bye. I got to go.

755
00:31:57,906 --> 00:32:01,664
My parents have been married for 40 years,

756
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:03,982
and that's, like, mind-blowing for me

757
00:32:03,983 --> 00:32:06,863
because there is no one worse at
communication than my mother,

758
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:09,303
except my father and most of my relatives.

759
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:11,893
It is not a chatty group, basically.

760
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:15,506
Everything in the Gilmore house was "don't
talk about it. Shove it aside."

761
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:18,995
Of course, I talked about it and shoved it
right in your face, but still, I don't know.

762
00:32:18,996 --> 00:32:21,322
I never saw myself getting married.

763
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:22,145
Never?

764
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:26,065
Not until Max asked me... I think.

765
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:29,466
I mean, I guess I thought about marrying
Christopher when everyone was freaking out

766
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:34,134
because I was pregnant,
but I never thought about it in a longingly,
good way.

767
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:36,221
- That could be why.
- Why?

768
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:39,683
Well, marriage was just a
solution to a problem,

769
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:42,683
not anything romantic or because
you were in love.

770
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:44,380
Plus it came from your parents.

771
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:47,315
I love that I've got one more
thing to blame my mother for.

772
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:49,685
What about Max? Did you love him?

773
00:32:49,855 --> 00:32:51,588
No, I didn't.

774
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:55,547
I wanted to, but... I didn't.

775
00:32:56,025 --> 00:32:59,931
I don't think I ever really
loved anyone until Luke.

776
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:02,664
Did I tell you I proposed?

777
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,107
No. You didn't.

778
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:05,548
I did.

779
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:10,716
I saw this guy in front of
me who was a real... man.

780
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:14,161
He was solid, and he was strong.

781
00:33:14,162 --> 00:33:17,329
He would protect me, but he-- he got me.

782
00:33:17,502 --> 00:33:20,613
I knew all that when we started dating.

783
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:25,672
But that moment,
when I realized how much he cared for Rory,
that was it.

784
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:28,249
Suddenly I knew I was ready.

785
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,650
Did he accept right away?

786
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:31,021
Pretty much.

787
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:35,215
Hey, where's the weirdest place
you ever had a session?

788
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:37,288
Skull mountain at six flags.

789
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:39,231
- So, not this.
- Nope, not this.

790
00:33:39,232 --> 00:33:42,041
Well, not only have I screwed up your night,
but it's not even a good story.

791
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,338
It's still a pretty good story.

792
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:45,403
Yeah, that's good,
'cause I like to entertain.

793
00:33:45,404 --> 00:33:50,049
You know, I should have been a monkey
in Washington Square Park
with, like, a snappy hat.

794
00:33:50,669 --> 00:33:52,329
I feel so stupid.

795
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,055
I really had myself believing
it was gonna happen.

796
00:33:56,056 --> 00:34:00,477
I bought that stupid dress,
and now it's just hanging there, mocking me.

797
00:34:00,478 --> 00:34:03,418
And the crazy thing is,
I am ready to get married.

798
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:07,524
I am ready to start the next phase of
my life. I want another kid, and I--

799
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:10,534
I don't want to wait anymore.
I don't want to be patient.

800
00:34:10,535 --> 00:34:15,433
I've been patient long enough. I'm not happy,
and I feel crappy all the time.

801
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:17,905
And I just think I've had it.

802
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:22,103
So... what are you gonna do?

803
00:34:22,537 --> 00:34:24,960
Only you can make you wait.

804
00:34:24,961 --> 00:34:26,270
Nobody else can.

805
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:30,091
You need to decide what you want and what
you're willing to give up to get it,

806
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:35,095
and then you got to be okay with that,
or you got to be okay with waiting.

807
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:37,127
I could lose him if I push too hard.

808
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:39,843
You don't really seem to have him now--

809
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,385
at least not the way you want to have him.

810
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:45,610
You won't get anything unless you ask for it.

811
00:34:45,956 --> 00:34:47,991
And if you ask for it and you don't get it,

812
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:51,136
maybe it wasn't worth having
in the first place.

813
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:54,210
Some things are just never meant to be,

814
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:56,978
no matter how much we wish they were.

815
00:34:58,987 --> 00:35:01,805
I can only imagine what you could
do if you had a couch.

816
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:07,211
Want to put money on who nails the queen?

817
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:09,420
I think her highness is pretty safe tonight.

818
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:11,241
Why? I thought Jenny and Paul broke up.

819
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:12,654
They got back together this morning.

820
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:13,901
- Do the boys know?
- No.

821
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:15,401
- Are you gonna tell them?
- No.

822
00:35:15,402 --> 00:35:19,402
Well, watching your best friends
waste precious scoring moments--

823
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:20,944
you can get kicked out of the club for that.

824
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,314
Yeah, well...

825
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:26,069
You know, I have given a lot of
great parties in my lifetime.

826
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,105
Oh, I know.

827
00:35:27,106 --> 00:35:30,140
But I do believe that this
one has topped them all.

828
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:32,120
Hey, it's not over. We have hours to go.

829
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:35,247
There's plenty of beer left,
and no one's slugged Finn yet, so...

830
00:35:35,248 --> 00:35:37,735
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

831
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:40,497
You want more beer?

832
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:41,514
No.

833
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:43,552
More twiglets, cadburys?

834
00:35:43,553 --> 00:35:45,112
I'm good.

835
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:48,403
Do you want try the frug again?
‘Cause I think my cramp has gone away.

836
00:35:48,404 --> 00:35:50,244
Tell me not to go.

837
00:35:51,647 --> 00:35:52,668
What?

838
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,546
Tell me not to get on that plane.

839
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:57,494
Tell me to blow off my father, the paper,
the whole Huntzberger destiny.

840
00:35:57,495 --> 00:36:00,962
Just tell me I can figure something else out.
Just tell me not to go.

841
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:04,561
Well, I can't do that.

842
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:13,179
Hey, you afraid the teacher's
gonna see or something?

843
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,063
No, I can't just charge you
for half a cup of coffee.

844
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:25,314
But I'm not gonna drink the whole cup.

845
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,135
Seems like a gyp.

846
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,015
Hey. I need to talk to you.

847
00:36:29,016 --> 00:36:31,078
- Where have you been?
- It doesn't matter.

848
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,235
What are you talking about "It
doesn't matter"? I've been
looking everywhere for you.

849
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:36,143
I tried your cell. I went by the Inn.
Patty was at your house.

850
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:38,120
- Let's elope.
- What?

851
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:40,898
Come on, Luke. Grab your keys. Let's go.

852
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:41,620
Elope?

853
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:43,399
You said that would be fine
at Martha's vineyard.

854
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,463
Didn't you say that would be
fine at Martha's vineyard?

855
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,030
Yes, I did. I'm just--

856
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:49,595
Come on, then! Let's go!
We can drive to Maryland.

857
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:52,434
What the hell, right? I mean,
you have to see Maryland eventually.

858
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:56,134
We can drive there, and get married,
and then come back here.

859
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:58,461
And you'll get your stuff,
and you'll move in.

860
00:36:58,462 --> 00:36:59,401
Okay, hold on.

861
00:36:59,402 --> 00:37:01,259
We have the plan already, right?

862
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,123
We just have to put the plan in motion.

863
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:05,815
Let's calm down.
We don't have to figure all this out now,
do we?

864
00:37:05,816 --> 00:37:08,799
Yes, we do, because we've been waiting
and waiting and putting it off,

865
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,337
and I don't want to put it off anymore.

866
00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:12,954
- But right now?
- Yes, now is the right time.

867
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:14,760
It's the best time because it's now!

868
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,376
- Come on.
- Your car or mine?

869
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:18,828
- Lorelai, let's just talk this through.
- No, I don’t wanna talk.

870
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:21,318
All we've done for months is talk.
I want to do. I want to go.

871
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,227
We can't just take off and get married.

872
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:25,858
- Why not, Luke? Don't you love me?
- You know I do.

873
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,176
But I love you, Luke. I love you.

874
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:30,006
But I have waited, and I have stayed away,

875
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:32,252
and I have let you run this thing,
and no more.

876
00:37:32,253 --> 00:37:34,599
I asked you to marry me, and you said yes.

877
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,282
Yeah, I'm just trying to think here.

878
00:37:36,283 --> 00:37:39,272
We fixed up the house, right?
We have a bigger closet,

879
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:43,371
and I didn't get the purple wallpaper because
you didn't want the purple wallpaper.

880
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:48,436
And if it's between you and the purple
wallpaper, I pick you! I pick you!

881
00:37:48,437 --> 00:37:50,088
I didn't tell you not to get
the purple wallpaper.

882
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:52,723
- Oh, my god, you didn't like it.
- I don't care about wallpaper!

883
00:37:52,724 --> 00:37:54,221
- Do you care about me?
- Yes!

884
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:56,128
Because I'm going crazy here.

885
00:37:56,129 --> 00:37:58,405
I made a commitment to you,
and I need to make it happen.

886
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:01,210
It will happen, okay?
I just have April to consider.

887
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:05,466
But once we're married,
everything with April will be fine.
Anna said so.

888
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:07,047
Anna said so? What does that mean?

889
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:09,360
- When I talked to Anna--
- When did you talk to Anna?

890
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:11,325
- After the party--
- I didn't know you talked to Anna.

891
00:38:11,326 --> 00:38:12,835
You weren't supposed to talk to Anna.

892
00:38:12,836 --> 00:38:15,794
I know. I'm sor-- God, no!
I'm not gonna defend myself!

893
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:18,291
For months now, I've been skulking
around not saying anything,

894
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:21,608
not having an opinion on anything,
like I'm Clarence Thomas or something,
and I--

895
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:23,177
I'm done with that.

896
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:26,129
I-I've been waiting for a long time,
and I don't want to wait anymore.

897
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,667
- I have to think this through.
- No!

898
00:38:27,668 --> 00:38:28,541
I have April.

899
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:31,549
You're gonna have to figure out how
April fits into our lives,
not the other way around.

900
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,425
I'm trying.

901
00:38:32,426 --> 00:38:34,141
- Well, try married!
- Just wait!

902
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:36,445
No! I'm not waiting! It's now or never!

903
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:37,659
I don't like ultimatums!

904
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,869
I don't like Mondays, but unfortunately
they come around eventually.

905
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,511
I can't just jump like this.

906
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:44,791
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

907
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,228
And I have to go.

908
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:04,579
# When I take a picture of
the city it disappears #

909
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:10,378
# It's only a photograph the city is gone #

910
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:14,579
# Places I go are never there #

911
00:39:15,984 --> 00:39:21,349
# The places I go are never the-e-e-e-re #

912
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,258
# And nostalgia isn't what it used to be #

913
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:31,522
# I can only picture the disappearing world #

914
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:34,933
# When you touch me #

915
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,480
- Hey.
- Hey.

916
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,354
You okay?

917
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:54,821
Uh, I'm having a really bad night, and, um...

918
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:57,833
I just don't want to be alone.

919
00:39:57,834 --> 00:39:59,244
- Okay?
- Yeah.

920
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:01,123
Uh, come on in.

921
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:10,897
Rory.

922
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:13,817
- Logan?
- Don't get up.

923
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:15,282
You're dressed.

924
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:16,407
Why are you dressed?

925
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:18,634
- My bags are already in the car.
- The car?

926
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:20,911
It's downstairs. I just wanted to tell you--

927
00:40:20,912 --> 00:40:23,406
I'll be five minutes.
I just have to find the closet.

928
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:24,246
Relax.

929
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,574
- I'll just grab shoes and a coat.
- No.

930
00:40:26,575 --> 00:40:28,573
- No shoes. Just a coat.
- You don't have to come.

931
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:30,237
You’re leaving.
I have to go with you to the airport.

932
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:30,892
No.

933
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:32,141
I have to go to say goodbye.

934
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:33,933
- Rory, no.
- Yes.

935
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:35,388
I have to wave to you at the gate.

936
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,556
They won't let you come to the gate.
They'll stop you at security.

937
00:40:37,557 --> 00:40:40,358
Okay, well,
I'll wave to you at the metal detectors.

938
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:41,360
Rory...

939
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:43,014
- I have to go with you.
- No!

940
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:46,564
Yes. You are leaving for London.
Who knows when we'll see each other again?

941
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:47,987
I thought that was all set.

942
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:48,956
What was all set?

943
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:50,991
Christmas, Thanksgiving, Guy Fawkes Day.

944
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:52,214
That's so far away.

945
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:56,338
Rory, if you come with me,
I won't get on the plane.

946
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:00,384
I've paid for the apartment
for the next year,

947
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:02,435
so you don't have to worry about that.

948
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,631
There's still a few weeks left on the car
service, so use it whenever you want.

949
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,735
I know that you won't,
but just in case you need to.

950
00:41:10,423 --> 00:41:12,847
I'll call you when I get in, okay?

951
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:22,159
What?

952
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:28,259
I keep trying to think of
fabulous things to say,

953
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,252
but all I can think is,
"say hi to William and Harry for me."

954
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:36,816
I love you, Ace.

955
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,755
That's so much better than "say hi
to William and Harry for me."

956
00:41:47,216 --> 00:41:48,679
I have to go.

957
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:27,315
G.G., come get your coat.

958
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:29,336
Not that coat. The pink coat.

959
00:42:29,337 --> 00:42:30,486
Miriam, where's the pink coat?

960
00:42:30,487 --> 00:42:32,149
She doesn't have a pink coat.

961
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,487
G.G.! Come back here!

962
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:38,820
- Who is that?
- Shh! That's your aunt Lorelai.

963
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:40,678
- Is she sick?
- No. Miriam...

964
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:42,272
Sorry, Mr. Hayden.

965
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:46,070
I don't like to wear my nightgown
to bed when I'm sick, either.

966
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:48,592
I'll explain later. Have fun at school.

967
00:42:48,593 --> 00:42:50,390
Bye-bye, hon.
