1
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:27,852
"Twenty-three is old. It's almost twenty-five, which is, like, almost mid-twenties."

2
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:29,653
- She did not say that.
- She did say that.

3
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,545
It seems a little wrong that Jessica Simpson is alive and well and Roy got eaten by his tiger.

4
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:35,439
Survival of the fittest, baby.

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,783
Oh, man, this place is packed.

6
00:00:38,526 --> 00:00:41,982
- Damn that Zagat guide.
- Only the loser mini-table is open.

7
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,011
- What do we do?
- Time to hover.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,936
- You take the old couple, I'll hit the cybergeek.
- Got it.

9
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:52,014
Hello.

10
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:55,286
Hello.

11
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:03,835
That was some of the best hovering I've ever seen you do.

12
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:07,343
- I was taught by the best.
- But the focus - you never blinked.

13
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:12,374
- And the sneeze - so tiny, so dainty, so terrifying to the old.
- Luke's gonna be mad.

14
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:15,912
- I mean, he hates it when we commandeer two tables during rush hour.
- Oh, he only hated it that one time.

15
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:19,140
- What time?
- The time when we did it and he was mad.

16
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:20,941
- He's hated it every time we've done it.
- No.

17
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,232
- Yes.
- No, only the one time.

18
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,742
- Which time?
- The time we did it and he was mad.

19
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:27,018
- You're gonna do this to Luke, aren't you?
- 'Til he's so dizzy he throws up.

20
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:29,578
- Nice. Calendars?
- Let's do it.

21
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:34,504
- Okay, so your finals-induced hibernation period is setting in...
- Monday.

22
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:38,749
Okay. So how about... Sunday we have a major Sephora fix,

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,962
- maybe a movie, sort of a see-ya day before you go bye-bye?
- Throw in a pedicure and you got a deal.

24
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:46,367
- Done.
- Coffee's gonna be ready in a sec. You know what you want?

25
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:50,704
Oh, well, we need napkins to cover this big, wide, expansive table.

26
00:01:50,755 --> 00:01:53,090
Okay. Hey, are you in the mood for pancakes?

27
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:56,690
Pancakes, sure, yeah. I guess we have enough space for pancakes.

28
00:01:56,756 --> 00:02:02,091
'Cause I'm making pumpkin pancakes and it comes with homemade cinnamon butter.

29
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:03,929
- You made cinnamon butter?
- This morning.

30
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,817
Wow. I bet the other people who would love a table right now but can't have one

31
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:09,832
'cause they're all taken would love pumpkin pancakes with homemade cinnamon butter.

32
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:11,512
- I'll get your coffee.
- Hey, hold on.

33
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,371
- What?
- We're sitting at two tables.

34
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,434
- Yeah?
- You hate that. That makes you mad.

35
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:18,306
- Only the one time.
- Why are you so sunny this morning?

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,510
- Well, actually, I finally hired some help.
- Oh, good for you.

37
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:26,483
Yeah, I figured I needed the help. What the hell, get a kid in here to pick up the slack, ya know?

38
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:29,888
- I kind of feel like a weight's been lifted, ya know?
- Sounds very sensible.

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,173
Let me get your food going.

40
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,521
- Okay, so, talk to me.
- Talk to you about what?

41
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,989
- Talk to me about Jason.
- There's nothing to talk about.

42
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:42,734
Oh, come on. I'm in a serious romantic dry spell. I need to live vicariously through somebody.

43
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:44,818
- He has called.
- Okay.

44
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,977
- He has sent things.
- Pipe bombs?

45
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:49,651
- Flowers, candy.
- Even better.

46
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:52,421
But I don't know, he's my father's partner, I've known him forever.

47
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:55,831
I mean, can you imagine if I actually went out with someone from my 'hood?

48
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:59,507
- Do you like him?
- Well, he's completely not my type, but...

49
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:03,736
he does have a thing and the smarts and he does keep up.

50
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:07,865
- Maybe you should just go out with him and see what happens.
- No. Dad would flip and Mom hates him,

51
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:12,062
so she would see it as some sort of personal attack and I'm just getting her off me for spilling wine on the carpet.

52
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:13,527
- When did you do that?
- Ninth grade.

53
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,492
Things are quiet now. I just wanna keep them quiet.

54
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:19,246
Hey, Brennon, pick up.

55
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:22,047
- Oh, my God.
- What?

56
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:26,189
- He hired Brennon Lewis.
- You know him?

57
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:27,960
- I went to junior high with him.
- And?

58
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:32,301
- He doesn't look that bad.
- He's the boy who dissected a frog,

59
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:37,542
- did not wash his hands, and then ate a sandwich.
- He's like the lost Farrelly brother. He's so stupid.

60
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,929
He watched "The Breakfast Club" and decided to tape his own butt cheeks together.

61
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:46,449
Okay, so Mensa's not sending him a t-shirt yet, but Luke has hired him so we have to give him a chance.

62
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,131
- You have the pancakes?
- We sure do.

63
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,521
- Hi, Brennon.
- Hey.

64
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,607
- Rory Gilmore. We went to school together.
- Yeah?

65
00:03:56,781 --> 00:04:00,054
You don't remember. Biology - the frog?

66
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,169
There have been a lot of frogs, man.

67
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:05,620
Okay. Thanks for the food.

68
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,815
Your kids will be gorgeous.

69
00:04:06,815 --> 00:05:09,529
This roommate of mine in sophomore year - we absolutely hated him.

70
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:14,479
He was, in addition to being a complete nincompoop, rather a chubby lad.

71
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,728
So one night, we tied him in between two mattresses and threw him out the window.

72
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,542
- What?
- I'm writing that one down.

73
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:23,542
- Was he okay?
- Oh, he was fine. He went to sleep.

74
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:27,576
- He woke up in the morning and picked up right where he left off.
- Man.

75
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:31,236
We wound up throwing him out the window every night for a month, and then he transferred.

76
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:34,002
Well, do you think you guys tossing him out the window on a regular basis

77
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:37,915
- had something to do with that decision?
- Well, it crossed our minds, yes.

78
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:42,030
However, we were young and full of energy. Every day was an adventure.

79
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,642
No challenge was too great. We wanted to change the world.

80
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:48,123
This is so great. Richard, I want to thank you for inviting me to lunch.

81
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:49,711
Well, you're very welcome, Paris.

82
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:54,794
How often does a man like me get the chance to entertain two such lovely and intelligent young ladies?

83
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:59,007
- You are a honey-tongued devil, aren't you, Dick?
- So, tell me, what are your plans for the game?

84
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:01,866
- The what?
- The game. The Harvard-Yale game.

85
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,824
- I'm going. I already have my ticket. I bought it a month ago.
- You did?

86
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:10,267
It's the game, Rory. It's a memory - a college memory, and I intend on having as many college memories as possible.

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,719
Your grandmother and I have attended every one of these games for the past 32 years.

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,879
We always buy a block of seats, and we got one for you. So how about it? We'd love to take you.

89
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:21,874
- And I would love to go.
- Good. It'll be a wonderful day.

90
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:24,029
- It will be a day to remember.
- Richard?

91
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,882
Asher! Oh, look at you!

92
00:06:27,978 --> 00:06:29,744
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

93
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:32,774
Your grandfather knows Asher Fleming? That's amazing.

94
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:37,301
I read his latest book four times. He was on Charlie Rose last week and he almost kept me awake.

95
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:40,711
- Well, I didn't know he knew him.
- I wonder if I can get an interview with him for the paper.

96
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:42,959
- What if I want an interview with him for the paper?
- What?

97
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,172
- Well, he's my grandfather.
- You're stealing my interview.

98
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,542
- No, I'm just making you crazy.
- Like that's hard. Feel proud.

99
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:51,549
Girls, I'd like to introduce you to a former classmate of mine - Asher Fleming.

100
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:54,296
- Asher, this is my granddaughter, Rory.
- Hello.

101
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:56,717
- A pleasure to meet you.
- And her friend, Paris Geller.

102
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,128
- Paris.
- I saw you on Charlie Rose. You were good.

103
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,591
- Thank you.
- Not too self-important, you made your point,

104
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:05,415
and managed to look remotely interested when Charlie babbled on pretentiously about nothing.

105
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,005
Well, Charlie Rose is a good friend of mine.

106
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:10,525
Whatever. Listen, professor, I'd love to do a profile on you for the paper.

107
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:15,435
Nothing puffy. Straight-up, hard-hitting, uncensored. Your views, no slant. Tomorrow work for you?

108
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:20,201
Well, I'll have to check my schedule. I do teach, you know.

109
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,147
Sure, you gotta pay the bills.

110
00:07:23,351 --> 00:07:27,775
Richard, terrific to see you again. Let's have lunch next week.

111
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,366
- Consider it a date.
- Splendid.

112
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:31,123
- Right.
- Goodbye, ladies.

113
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:34,656
I'm a fan!

114
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:40,860
- I could've opened with that, couldn't I have?
- Then you wouldn't be you.

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,904
Okay, see, a better man, a smarter man, a different man, would take into account the fact that

116
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:55,920
flowers, candy, and numerous phone calls have gone completely unnoticed by you.

117
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,559
Those men would get a clue, have some pride, grow a pair, and move on.

118
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:04,993
Oh, well. Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Richard and Emily, mother of Rory, and friend to all,

119
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,642
would you join me for dinner on Saturday night? Please call me back

120
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:12,437
because I will someday find my pathetic threshold and stop trying.

121
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,737
- This is Jason.
- This is Lorelai.

122
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:21,525
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

123
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:24,080
- You're really calling me back?
- Yes, I am.

124
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:28,066
Is there someone there who could document this - a photographer or a really fast painter?

125
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,920
See, you get the girl to call you back and then you give her a hard time.

126
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:35,313
- You're right, I apologize. So, how are you?
- I'm fine, and you?

127
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:39,844
I don't know. I've got a slight suspicion you've called to tell me you're not available for dinner on Saturday night,

128
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:42,727
- and that's gonna bum me out.
- Look, Jason...

129
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:46,397
Okay, before you continue, just let me say that I got us reservations at the China Garden.

130
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:51,467
- Ah, you're kidding.
- Very hot ticket in town. Good food, great bar, quite a scene.

131
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:54,262
- How did you do that?
- Pulled a few strings, greased a few palms,

132
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:58,722
- sold myself to a sous-chef - a very tender man, I might add.
- I just want you to be happy.

133
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,771
So, long story short - table for two at 8:30. You need a little black dress.

134
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:05,245
- I am so incredibly tempted.
- But?

135
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:10,964
But you work with my father. You're hated by my mother. You come from my world.

136
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:14,732
- You find me repulsive.
- No, I don't, and I wish I did.

137
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,683
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna keep the reservation and go by myself.

138
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:23,236
I've been reading about this place for months, and personally, I would like to see what all the fuss is about.

139
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:27,829
- Do you understand at all where I'm coming from?
- Nope, but that's okay.

140
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,991
- Well, I'm sorry, Jason.
- Me, too.

141
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:33,180
- I bet you look good in one of those little black dresses.
- Well, yes, I do.

142
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,515
- Goodbye, Lorelai.
- Bye, Jason.

143
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:40,757
It's ten o'clock at night and suddenly I hear this terrible racket.

144
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:47,383
So I go outside and there is May Richmond sneaking a 6-foot Rudolph into her garage.

145
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:50,557
- That woman is working my last nerve. 
- So what?

146
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:53,974
- So what? Don't you know what this means? 
- I'm racking my brain.

147
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:58,662
- They're going to put a giant plastic reindeer on their roof. 
- Which is right next to our roof.

148
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:01,590
So, what, are you scared they'll keep you up all night playing reindeer games?

149
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:06,993
They can't light them up. The homeowners association has very strict rules about the amount of lights

150
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:10,894
that you can display in front of your house, and they already have those lawn twinklers.

151
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:14,412
They could give up their lawn twinklers and focus solely on the reindeer.

152
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:18,472
I don't know. They were awfully proud of their twinklers last year. It was all they talked about.

153
00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:22,777
Okay, guys - take a step back, examine the conversation you're having, and spend some time apart.

154
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,881
- May I have some more roast, please, Grandma? 
- Of course you may.

155
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:28,323
- It's really good tonight, Mom.
- Thank you, Lorelai.

156
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:33,750
Oh, by the way, Rory, we will pick you up in front of your residence hall tomorrow morning, nine o'clock sharp.

157
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:35,660
- Okay. 
- Tomorrow? What's happening tomorrow?

158
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:37,994
- Tomorrow's the game. 
- Oh, the game...

159
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:41,134
- The game. The Harvard-Yale game. 
- Right, right. Football?

160
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,866
- Lorelai. 
- Why does the question "Football?" get a "Lorelai"?

161
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:48,342
Yes, it's football - the most important football game of the entire year.

162
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:51,737
- All of Yale will be there. 
- Oh, cool. Can I go?

163
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,244
- You want to go to a football game? 
- Well, if it's such a big deal, absolutely.

164
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:56,902
But you don't like football. 

165
00:10:57,006 --> 00:11:01,802
Well, no, I'm not the diehard fan that, say, you are, Mom, but it's Rory's school.

166
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:03,300
You won't get bored? 

167
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes, of course I'll get bored, but that's when the "South Park" impressions kick in.

168
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,829
- Lorelai, we have invited friends - important people. 
- I'm kidding, Mom. I can only do Cartman.

169
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:13,447
- So, you want to go? 
- Yup.

170
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:16,263
- You're sure about this? 
- Absolutely positive.

171
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,102
- Well, I guess we could uninvite someone. 
- Cecil, perhaps.

172
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,668
- Or Donlon. 
- Donlon just had his colon removed.

173
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:27,024
Well, Cecil then. I guess I should call him now, give him time to get another ticket.

174
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,946
- I'll call his wife. 
- Thanks.

175
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:31,741
What is wrong with you? 

176
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,941
What is wrong with you? Why didn't you get me a ticket to the game?

177
00:11:34,014 --> 00:11:36,252
- I was saving you, dummy. 
- Saving me from what?

178
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,135
- You hate football. 
- So do you.

179
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:41,729
Yeah, I know I hate football, but I couldn't get out of it. You could.

180
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:45,354
Okay, so I have to go watch a football game. At least I get to hang with you before finals.

181
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:46,356
- You sure? 
- Of course. 

182
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:48,852
I mean, what's a football game last? Hour, hour and a half?

183
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,760
Longer than an hour and a half? Are you kidding me?

184
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:58,764
Damn it. Emily, Cecil's the one who had his colon removed. I'm calling Donlon.

185
00:12:04,196 --> 00:12:07,861
- I hate football. 
- I tried to get you out of it.

186
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:10,356
- Well, you should have tried harder. 
- Next time.

187
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:13,821
- Where's Luke? 
- Probably in bed where the rest of the world is on a Saturday.

188
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,152
- Did I put on underwear? 
- What?

189
00:12:16,284 --> 00:12:18,824
I think I forgot to put on underwear. Can you check?

190
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:23,922
- Did I just ask you to check if I put on underwear? 
- Yes.

191
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,344
- I hate football. 
- You just need coffee.

192
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:29,074
- Oh, no. 
- What?

193
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:30,442
- Froggy. 
- Brennon?

194
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,669
- I hate that kid. 
- I thought we were gonna give him a chance.

195
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:35,649
Yeah, chance ended when he dumped a chili-bean omelet on me the other day.

196
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,297
What do we do? Oh, he's coming over.

197
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:41,204
- What can I do for you, chicas? 
- Oh, we'd just like to order, please.

198
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:44,340
- Go ahead. 
- I'll have the cheese omelet, extra cheddar, no Jack,

199
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,224
sourdough toast, two bacons, two sausages... you're not writing this down. 

200
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,224
Don't need to. Continue.

201
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:54,219
Two bacons, two sausages, one pancake... I would really like you to write this down.

202
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,357
- Trust me, it's all stored. What would you like? 
- Rye toast.

203
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,480
- You want that toasted? 
- Sure, why not?

204
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:03,640
- Got it. 
- Rye toast?

205
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,324
My odds are way better than yours.

206
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,616
- Brennon! 
- Oh, nice volume.

207
00:13:08,817 --> 00:13:10,906
- This is a box of doughnuts. 
- Yeah?

208
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:13,060
It's supposed to be a box of bagels.

209
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,464
- What, they both have holes in them, right? 
- We've already had this conversation.

210
00:13:17,598 --> 00:13:20,337
Get me the bagels, get me the bagels! Go. Now. Bye.

211
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:27,284
- Excuse me, can I get a napkin? 
- Yeah, sure.

212
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:32,876
Excuse me, can I get a napkin to put my napkin on?

213
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:37,192
You know, this is so completely unfair. I didn't even know Luke was looking for someone.

214
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:39,492
- I would love to work here. 
- Your mother would have let you?

215
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:42,170
I mean, Luke is a man. With man parts, we think.

216
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:46,828
Luke's is one of the few Mrs. Kim-approved places. No alcohol, walking distance to the church,

217
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:52,260
and you can see my house from here. I totally need the money, and instead I get to return a box of doughnuts once a day.

218
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:54,784
- Rye toast. 
- Told ya.

219
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,044
You wanted... something, right?

220
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,964
- Oh, excuse me just a second, won't you? 
- Sure.

221
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:05,040
- Luke? 
- What are you doing here?

222
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:08,314
- We're going to the Harvard-Yale game. 
- You're going to the Harvard-Yale game?

223
00:14:08,406 --> 00:14:10,580
- You know what they do at the Harvard-Yale game? 
- They make babies?

224
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:12,295
- They play football. 
- Yes, I know they pay football.

225
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:15,443
- And you're supposed to watch them play football. 
- Let's not talk about me anymore.

226
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,466
- Let's talk about you. I'm worried. 
- Why?

227
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:21,783
Ever since you hired Brennon, the little spark has gone out of your eyes.

228
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:23,384
- It has? 
- Yes, it has.

229
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:29,780
And I am here to tell you that it is hell watching you go through this, so I think for your own sake, you should fire Froggy.

230
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:31,392
- Froggy? 
- Brennon.

231
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,140
- You want me to fire Brennon, why? 
- The spark. Remember the spark?

232
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,818
- Why do you want me to fire Brennon? 
- Come back, little spark, come back.

233
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:39,754
- Lorelai. 
- He doesn't write the orders down,

234
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:43,558
he never brings you food that's hot or yours, he can't distinguish bagels from doughnuts,

235
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,285
he hands out butt napkins, and he has worn that Foreigner t-shirt every single day since he started working here

236
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:51,944
- and he doesn't know who they are. I asked him. 
- What are butt napkins?

237
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,115
Kirk needed a napkin, and he pulled one out of his back pocket.

238
00:14:56,614 --> 00:14:58,698
- Hey, Bren? 
- Yeah, boss?

239
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,570
- Did you give Kirk a napkin out of your back pocket? 
- Yeah.

240
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,315
- Don't. 
- Okay.

241
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:10,050
- That's it? What about all the other stuff? 
- Look, you're just used to me. Give him time.

242
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,579
Have you heard about the frog, the hands, and the sandwich?

243
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:16,286
- No, but I heard about the rabbi, the priest, and the duck. 
- You're not taking me seriously.

244
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:19,622
Hey, Bren, get Ms. Gilmore a cup of hot coffee, will ya?

245
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:25,337
Give the kid a chance, all right? He's helping me out a great deal - decaf - and I have faith in him.

246
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,212
All he needs is a little more time - black top - to learn the ropes and he'll be fine.

247
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:35,716
- Where did he go? 
- I don't know.

248
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:45,213
Where are they all going? It's Saturday morning, they should be in bed.

249
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:48,971
- They're excited about life. It's a college thing. 
- How come you're not excited about life?

250
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,814
I find nothing exciting before eleven.

251
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,993
- Yoo-hoo, girls, over here! 
- God, who's yoo-hooing?

252
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,069
- Oh, my God. 
- Lorelai, Rory.

253
00:15:58,146 --> 00:16:00,762
- It's a fine day for football. 
- And funny hats.

254
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:04,585
If you're going to continue sitting on the ground like that, you should get yourself a saxophone and a tip cup.

255
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:06,691
- Sorry. Up. 
- Right.

256
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,762
- Lorelai, what are you wearing? 
- I'm sorry, you're horrified by what I'm wearing?

257
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:13,394
- You're wearing crimson. 
- I'm not wearing crimson.

258
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,917
- Oh, she can't go like that. 
- Crimson is Harvard's color.

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,826
That's a very dangerous choice to make today, Lorelai.

260
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,992
- I'm not wearing crimson. I'm wearing red. 
- Same thing.

261
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,427
- Very different. 
- Look at Rory. Rory is dressed in Yale colors.

262
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:27,915
- Why can't you be like Rory? 
- Rory looks perfect.

263
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:30,899
Rory got dressed five minutes before you got here, and she's wearing my sweater.

264
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:34,191
- I could just as easily have been the one dressed right. 
- You can wear my jacket.

265
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:36,421
Do you have a samurai sword under those pom-poms, Mom?

266
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:39,000
- Because you're gonna have to "Kill Bill" me to get me into that... 
- Arm.

267
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:41,549
- Yes, ma'am. 
- What have you got there, Rory?

268
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:43,403
- Fig Newtons. 
- Fig Newtons?

269
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:44,601
A little dessert for later.

270
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:49,773
- What's so funny? 
- We got the jumbo pack. We're not cheap.

271
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,715
I'm sorry, Rory, we didn't mean to laugh at you. We love your Fig Newtons.

272
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:56,970
- We will honor them and eat them proudly. 
- They're just Fig Newtons, guys.

273
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,178
- Don't get all freaky on us. 
- Well, let's get going.

274
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:01,061
- So, what time does the game start? 
- One.

275
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,279
- One? 
- Then why the hell did we have to meet you at nine?

276
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,620
Is it absolutely necessary for you to talk like Sharon Osbourne?

277
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:07,804
You're the one with the dirty button.

278
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,866
There's much more to the big game day than the game, Lorelai.

279
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:17,348
There are all kinds of rituals and traditions we Gilmores take part in. First off, a visit to Dan.

280
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:19,150
- A visit to Dan. 
- Who's Dan?

281
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:20,937
- Come along, ladies. 
- Who's Dan?

282
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:22,345
Button your coat.

283
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:24,389
Who's Dan?

284
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:27,379
Girls, I'd like you to meet Dan.

285
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:33,056
- The original Handsome Dan. 
- The very first Yale mascot.

286
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:35,499
- Oh, my. 
- Just look at him, will you.

287
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:40,450
- Strong, determined, the very essence of dignity. 
- Got cotton stuffed in his butt. How dignified is that?

288
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:45,463
You will not sully the name of Dan. This dog has been the inspiration for many a young man.

289
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,263
- And young woman. 
- We salute you, Dan.

290
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,526
- Time for a toast. 
- Seriously?

291
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:53,936
Oh, it's a tradition. Here we go.

292
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:58,908
The Rory flask. And the fun flask.

293
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,175
- Thank you. 
- Lorelai?

294
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,445
Fun flask, please.

295
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:10,500
All right, give our boys the strength to do battle yet again for the honor of Yale,

296
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:13,685
and help us send the Harvard boys home in a body bag.

297
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,383
- Dan, we salute you. 
- To Dan.

298
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:17,647
- To Dan. 
- To Dan.

299
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:22,097
- I like football. 
- I must admit, throughout the years,

300
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:26,105
I have often hoped to be able to share this day with my granddaughter.

301
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:30,576
It's selfish, I know, but I am thrilled to be here with you, Rory.

302
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,721
To Rory.

303
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:36,027
Two more of these and I'm gonna start to understand your outfit. 

304
00:18:36,194 --> 00:18:42,427
Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow, Eli Yale...

305
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:45,889
- What is he doing? 
- Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow...

306
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:49,724
- They're joining him. 
- Apparently, everyone has a fun flask.

307
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:53,512
- You know, Cole Porter wrote that song. 
- Was that before he learned to write songs?

308
00:18:53,672 --> 00:19:01,242
That is the sign we hail! Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow, Eli Yale!

309
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:07,579
- All right, everyone, time to move on. 
- Yes, we have a lot of things to get to.

310
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:10,310
Yeah, I hear there's a squirrel encased in concrete next door. We have to burn incense, 

311
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:13,010
dance around his tail with nuts in our mouths.

312
00:19:13,078 --> 00:19:16,764
- What can I possibly do to stop you? 
- A little more of the fun flask might do the trick.

313
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:19,303
- That's all until we eat. 
- Where are we going to eat?

314
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:21,869
- It's a tailgate party. 
- I'm sorry, a what?

315
00:19:22,033 --> 00:19:25,242
Oh, well, don't look so shocked, Lorelai. Tailgating was invented at Yale.

316
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:28,335
Tailgating like tailgating? Like a beer and a hot dog in the parking lot?

317
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:29,970
Walk a little faster, please.

318
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:32,529
- Did they say "tailgating"? 
- I think so.

319
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,366
- I wanted to make sure it wasn't the fun flask talking. 
- Girls.

320
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,949
- Oh, so this is tailgating. 
- It smells so good.

321
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:45,334
- Hey, how are ya? Go, Yale? Hi, I'm Lorelai. 
- I'm Benny.

322
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:48,827
Wow, great to meet you, Benny. Tell me about this barbecue sauce.

323
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:51,791
Please don't harass people. Your daughter goes to this school.

324
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:55,871
Hi, Mom, I'd like you to meet Benny. Benny, this is my mother, Emily. We were thinking a summer wedding.

325
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,245
- It's nice to meet you. We're over there. 
- I don't care where you are.

326
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:02,450
- I have found my place in life. It's here, right next to... 
- Oh, my God.

327
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:03,510
- What? 
- Look.

328
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,151
Richard, make sure he doesn't burn those.

329
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,441
See ya, Benny. Okay, let's tailgate. I really like football.

330
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:20,258
- How's that? 
- Oh, that's fine if we were in Utah.

331
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,614
Message received.

332
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,327
Don't keep drinking that, Richard. I'm making my Bloody Mary's.

333
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,963
You have been working on your Bloody Mary's for an hour now.

334
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:29,663
Rome wasn't built in a day.

335
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:31,511
Taste that, Lorelai.

336
00:20:35,106 --> 00:20:37,251
- Too strong? 
- Just a tad.

337
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,788
Yeah, I'm sitting across from it and I'm looking for a lampshade to wear. 

338
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,988
All right, all right.

339
00:20:41,092 --> 00:20:44,941
Rory, come with me. I want to introduce you to some good friends of mine. 

340
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:48,802
- He is so proud of that girl. 
- I know.

341
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:52,872
- Sometimes that's all he can talk about. 
- Yeah, well, it's a pretty good subject.

342
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:57,766
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my granddaughter, Rory, class of 2007.

343
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:03,082
- So, any word from that little ex-hoodlum of hers? 
- No, Jess seems to be gone for good.

344
00:21:03,184 --> 00:21:07,397
- How is she? 
- She's Rory. She's stoic. She's a lot like Dad.

345
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,206
She is, isn't she?

346
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:14,971
- And what about you? Any men snooping around? 
- Just on trash day.

347
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,889
- There must be someone. 
- No, no, no one.

348
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:21,704
All right. Any weaker and it would simply be tomato juice.

349
00:21:24,146 --> 00:21:25,518
- Very nice. 
- Yes?

350
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,429
Perfect.

351
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:30,864
- Hi. 
- Hi, Paris.

352
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,121
- Is Rory here? 
- Oh, no, she's over there with her grandfather.

353
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,642
- She'll be right back. Mom, do you know Paris? 
- Of course I know Paris.

354
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:40,331
She came to Rory's sixteenth birthday party. Nice to see you again. Would you like some lemonade?

355
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:41,856
No, thank you. I won't be here long.

356
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:44,114
Oh, Rory, good.

357
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:46,833
- Here. 
- What's this?

358
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:48,803
- I want you to take a win/lose photo. 
- A what?

359
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,589
A photo as if we won and a photo as if we lost. That way, I have it to remember the day by.

360
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:54,681
Why don't you just wait until we win or lose to take the photo?

361
00:21:54,795 --> 00:21:58,866
Oh, please, I'm already so bored out of my mind, I'm thinking of transferring to Princeton for the hell of it.

362
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:01,743
There's no way I'm gonna make it to the game. Just take the picture so I can go home.

363
00:22:01,815 --> 00:22:04,191
Okay. We won.

364
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:07,667
- We lost. We're done. 
- I'm out of here.

365
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,148
- Oh, hello, Paris. Join us for some food? 
- No, thanks, Richard.

366
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:13,504
Oh, by the way, thanks again for introducing me to Asher Fleming. 

367
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:14,984
Oh, did you get your interview?

368
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:19,213
- No, not yet, but I'm working on it. 
- Well, I pity him if he tries to resist too long.

369
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:21,670
- Oh, so do I. Bye. 
- Bye, Paris.

370
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:27,179
- She's an odd little duck, that one. 
- Don't I get one of those?

371
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:28,802
Well, of course you do.

372
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:32,186
- Richard, Emily, hello. 
- Pennilyn.

373
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:34,281
- Nice to see you. 
- How are things?

374
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:36,283
- Perfect. You? 
- Lovely. How's work?

375
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,495
- Just fine. How's Stephen? 
- Oh, you know.

376
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:41,715
- This is our daughter, Lorelai, and our granddaughter, Rory. 
- Hello.

377
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:43,604
- It's been so long, we must catch up. 
- You'll call?

378
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:44,786
- Of course. 
- Well, then...

379
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:49,186
Oh, wait, are you Pennilyn Lott, my dad's college sweetheart?

380
00:22:49,427 --> 00:22:51,623
- Yes. 
- You're my almost-mommy.

381
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:55,934
- Well, I suppose you could put it that way. 
- I'm so glad to finally meet you.

382
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:58,805
Let me ask you something - would you have let me get a pony?

383
00:22:59,103 --> 00:23:02,247
- I'll call you, Pennilyn. 
- Yes, I look forward to it.

384
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,225
Bye.

385
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:07,726
- Lorelai! Does anything work above your neck? 
- What?

386
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:10,506
- What were you thinking? 
- I'm sorry, I was just trying to talk to her.

387
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,964
We do not talk to Pennilyn Lott. 

388
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:15,846
We run into her once a year. We say hello, goodbye, and that is it.

389
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:19,270
- We do not have conversations, we do not talk about our lives. 
- But Mom...

390
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:23,910
We do not joke with Pennilyn Lott. We do not refer to Pennilyn Lott as anything but Pennilyn Lott,

391
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,759
and I would appreciate you remembering that.

392
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:28,509
Okay, seriously time for the fun flask.

393
00:23:32,528 --> 00:23:34,341
- Hey, Patty. 
- Hi, sweetie.

394
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,462
- Gypsy. 
- Hey Luke.

395
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:36,865
- Reverend Skinner. 
- Afternoon, son.

396
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,085
- Oh, hey, Kirk, I got that cheese in you like. 
- The Pepper Jack?

397
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:43,275
Pepper Jack, yes. Anyway, it's here, it's in if you're coming by today. 

398
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:45,416
- Are you? 
- Am I coming by today?

399
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:46,762
- Yes. 
- No, not today.

400
00:23:47,023 --> 00:23:52,987
Kirk, listen, I got that cheese just for you. Do not leave me with three pounds of Pepper Jack on my hands.

401
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:54,841
- I won't. 
- What are you doing here anyway?

402
00:23:54,943 --> 00:23:56,828
- Standing in line. 
- Why are you standing in line?

403
00:23:56,926 --> 00:23:58,165
Because I'm a follower.

404
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:00,150
- Patty? 
- Yes, Luke?

405
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:05,348
- What are all these people standing in line for? 
- Well, it seems like such a nice day for pie.

406
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:08,580
- What's going on here? 
- I'm sticking to the pie story.

407
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:11,098
- Why do you need a pie story, Kirk? 
- Ask Gypsy.

408
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:15,252
- Don't pawn this off on me. 
- Will somebody tell me what the hell is going on?

409
00:24:15,342 --> 00:24:17,026
- Luke... 
- Oh, sorry, Reverend.

410
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:20,503
- No, I was just gonna tell you what's going on. 
- Oh, good. Go ahead.

411
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:23,232
- We're all here for lunch. 
- Since when does Weston's serve lunch?

412
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:26,560
- We're sorry, Luke. We really are. 
- You're sorry about what?

413
00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:31,194
- About not eating at your diner anymore. 
- You're not eating at my diner anymore? Why?

414
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:32,909
- We hate the kid. 
- Brennon?

415
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:34,401
Brennon, Satan, whatever. 

416
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:37,481
Wait a minute, don't you think you're all just overreacting a little bit?

417
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,595
- He's just a kid. 
- A really weird kid.

418
00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:44,977
He'll be looking directly at you and start laughing. No one knows why. He's just there, laughing.

419
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:48,264
He laughs? That's why you hate him? The kid laughs?

420
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:50,521
- You'd have to hear it. 
- I don't believe you people.

421
00:24:50,634 --> 00:24:55,709
You've been coming to my diner for years, and now, all of a sudden, because I give a local kid a break,

422
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:01,683
try to teach him a skill, give him a chance to get a little extra cash, a little independence, you all just up and leave?

423
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:08,176
I mean, so he's not the most popular kid in town. If I remember correctly, I wasn't exactly the most popular kid in town either.

424
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:14,064
- Yeah, but you didn't do that laughing thing. 
- Yeah, whatever I did, I grew up, I got responsible.

425
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,254
This town gave me a chance, and I proved them right.

426
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:21,724
Now you're all just gonna stand there and tell me that that's it, that you've given out all the passes that you had

427
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:27,228
and you're not coming to my diner anymore because you don't like Brennon? Well, fine.

428
00:25:27,304 --> 00:25:34,309
Fine! Do not come to my diner. From now on, every day is a nice day for pie.

429
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:47,129
Just give me ten minutes.

430
00:25:52,225 --> 00:25:55,142
I think I have officially eaten a third of a cow.

431
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,298
The steak is incredible.

432
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,411
I'm glad you're all enjoying it. Lorelai, how's your steak?

433
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:05,204
- Why do you ask? 
- That's it. Hand over the flask.

434
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:08,440
- I do not know what you're talking about. There's no flask here. 
- What's going on over there?

435
00:26:09,372 --> 00:26:12,659
- Oh, Richard, it's Dan. 
- Dan? It's Dan! It's Dan!

436
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,368
- I thought we already saw Dan. 
- This is the current Dan.

437
00:26:15,752 --> 00:26:17,651
- Emily, get his bone. 
- Got it.

438
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,851
- Here you go, Dan. 
- Enjoy it now. I just saw your future and it ain't good.

439
00:26:23,943 --> 00:26:25,453
Rory, hey.

440
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:28,705
- Hey, did you see Dan? 
- Well, you can't help it. 

441
00:26:28,806 --> 00:26:31,045
He's everywhere today in one form or another.

442
00:26:31,128 --> 00:26:34,198
- I want you to meet my mom. 
- I'll distract them, and you make a run for it.

443
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:38,079
Dan, are you listening to me? Stop eating. Your freedom's at stake here.

444
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:40,146
- Mom? 
- I was just petting him.

445
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,461
- I want you to meet Marty. 
- Oh, naked guy.

446
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:46,425
- You told your mother about me. 
- Yeah.

447
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,205
Well, I included some anecdotes where you were actually clothed, too. 

448
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:50,045
Oh, I appreciate that.

449
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:53,593
- And who is this young man? 
- This is Marty. He lives in my residence hall.

450
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:58,160
- It's very nice to meet you, Marty. 
- Why did my daughter just call you "naked guy"?

451
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:02,486
- I now owe you money. 
- I had an unfortunate experience with a keg

452
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:05,706
and a party and a need to take my clothes off and fall asleep in a hallway. 

453
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:06,926
Oh, my goodness.

454
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:08,544
Oh, please, that's nothing.

455
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:11,570
- I was naked an entire month my sophomore year. 
- What?

456
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,698
Welcome to tonight's episode of "Things I Never Needed to Know About My Father."

457
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:22,112
I and a group of like-minded young men decided to protest the new dress code by wearing silk ties and nothing else.

458
00:27:22,189 --> 00:27:25,123
We were written up by the dean of admissions and threatened with expulsion.

459
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:28,816
- We were also suddenly very popular with the ladies. 
- Ah, yes.

460
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:34,076
This is exactly the kind of conversation I had hoped we would have with our granddaughter and her friend.

461
00:27:34,124 --> 00:27:38,808
One night in the hallway does not a true naked guy make, my friend.

462
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:44,721
- Would you like to eat with us, Marty? 
- Oh, I would love to. It looks amazing. But I have to go.

463
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:50,656
There's kind of a party going on over on the lawn, and I actually came by to see if Rory wanted to stop by for a little while.

464
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:54,219
- Oh, I can't. 
- Oh, nonsense, of course you can go.

465
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:56,785
- Go visit your friends. I insist. 
- Are you sure?

466
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:59,002
We've got plenty of time before the kickoff, go.

467
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,952
- Okay. 
- Take this with you.

468
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,715
Thanks. It was nice meeting you. Obi-wan.

469
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:10,266
- I like that boy. 
- Prove it. Drop your pants.

470
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:12,099
- All right, come on. 
- Come on where?

471
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,725
- It's time to go to the ladies' room. 
- It is? Was there a memo, or...

472
00:28:14,817 --> 00:28:18,116
It's an hour before kickoff. The lines won't be long. Grab your purse. You'll thank me later.

473
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:20,859
I'll meet you right outside.

474
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:25,898
Coffee, please.

475
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:35,862
- Here you go. 
- Thanks.

476
00:28:40,197 --> 00:28:42,794
Of course there's a line. Why wouldn't there be?

477
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:45,840
- You know, you kind of want to hang out here anyhow. 
- Why is that?

478
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:48,590
- Some woman just took her forty-year-old son in there. 
- No.

479
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:52,178
He might not be forty, but the images he's gathering up in there will last until he gets there.

480
00:28:52,256 --> 00:28:54,022
- Why do women do that? 
- I don't know.

481
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:57,876
When I was growing up, there was such a thing as modesty. I suppose that's not in fashion now.

482
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:01,789
- Nope, modesty went punk. 
- So, I hear you're opening an inn.

483
00:29:01,896 --> 00:29:04,242
- Well, trying to. 
- That sounds very exciting.

484
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,229
It is.

485
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:09,177
- Pennilyn, we're just running into you all over the place. 
- Yes, you are.

486
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:12,428
- Well, it's a nice treat. Enjoy the game. 
- Same to you.

487
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,388
- Oops, the line's moving. 
- Oh, I'll see you later.

488
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:17,446
Yes. Let's go, Lorelai.

489
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:19,822
Did you see the woman with the forty-year-old kid?

490
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:27,855
Oh, Emily, good. I can't remember whether it's two shakes of Tabasco or four.

491
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:31,438
- I'll do it. 
- I did however remember how much vodka goes in there.

492
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:33,759
- You're going to have to move if you want me to make them. 
- But I don't want to move.

493
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,198
I want to stand right here, dangerously close to my wife as long as...

494
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:39,611
Whiffenpoofs!

495
00:29:49,257 --> 00:29:53,752
There's no celery. Sandy, I told you to cut enough celery for the entire day.

496
00:30:06,629 --> 00:30:09,558
- He's gonna be in so much pain tomorrow. 
- What is this?

497
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:13,322
- Sandy, what is this? 
- It's the cookies.

498
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:18,611
It's the cookies my granddaughter brought. I told you to place them on a doily, not just dump them on a plate.

499
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:20,863
- I'm sorry. 
- Take them, fix them.

500
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,496
And where's the celery?

501
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,411
- I can get you celery, Mom. 
- I didn't hire you to get me celery.

502
00:30:28,548 --> 00:30:31,978
- I know, but I'm happy to help. 
- Sandy, I don't want to ask you again.

503
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:34,273
- Is something wrong, Mom? 
- No, nothing's wrong.

504
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:37,272
These are the best Bloody Mary's I have ever tasted.

505
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:41,798
- Emily, let's give these boys some refreshments. 
- We can't give them any refreshments

506
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:45,818
because we don't have any celery even though I've been asking for it repeatedly for the last ten minutes.

507
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:47,636
We can drink them without celery.

508
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,503
How does Pennilyn Lott know that Lorelai's opening an inn?

509
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:55,602
- Excuse me? 
- She knows that Lorelai's opening an inn. How did she know?

510
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:59,360
- Well... 
- I didn't tell her. I don't think Lorelai told her.

511
00:30:59,448 --> 00:31:02,657
I can't remember the last time Rory and Pennilyn had a hen party. 

512
00:31:02,748 --> 00:31:03,457
Mom...

513
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,716
Once a year - that's when we talk to her. Once a year, right here at the game.

514
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:11,812
We say hello, we ask about her health, we ask about her children, and if Stephen's not here, we ask about him.

515
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:14,214
- How did she know? 
- I told her.

516
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:16,681
- Run. 
- When?

517
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,943
About six months ago. We had lunch.

518
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:22,385
- Where? 
- At a restaurant.

519
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,280
- What restaurant? 
- You don't know it.

520
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:27,168
- Why don't I know it? 
- Because you've never been there.

521
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,533
How do you know I've never been there? You don't know everything about me.

522
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,512
I don't know everything about you. I didn't know you were having lunch with Pennilyn Lott.

523
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:34,050
We obviously don't know everything about each other. 

524
00:31:34,154 --> 00:31:36,250
- What restaurant? 
- Adele's.

525
00:31:36,307 --> 00:31:39,971
- I've never been there. 
- We just had lunch and talked. Two old friends.

526
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:46,276
How nice. So, after all of these years of not having lunch and not talking, you two decide to get together and catch up.

527
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:49,629
- Whose idea was it? 
- Emily, could we discuss this in the trailer?

528
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:53,414
- We will discuss this right here. Whose idea was it? 
- I don't know.

529
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,352
We've been having lunch once a year for many years. It's just a little tradition.

530
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:03,197
- Every year since when? 
- Every year since we got married.

531
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:08,268
Emily, please don't make this more dramatic than it has to be.

532
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:13,074
- No, I certainly wouldn't want to do that. 
- Pennilyn and I are just friends.

533
00:32:13,258 --> 00:32:16,464
We just wanted to keep track of each other. That was it.

534
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:21,906
- So, you've lied to me for the last 39 years. 
- Well, she didn't tell Stephen. It was only lunch.

535
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:24,968
- Only lunch, yes. 
- Emily, I...

536
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,791
I think you should go for a walk, Richard.

537
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,600
I'll be back before the game.

538
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:38,013
Mom, I know it was wrong, but I'm sure Dad just didn't want to get you upset.

539
00:32:38,137 --> 00:32:43,219
Well, then perhaps he shouldn't have lied to me for the last 39 years. That's a surefire way not to get me upset.

540
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:47,194
- That's true, but it was just lunch. 
- It was lunch with Pennilyn Lott, Lorelai,

541
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,166
the woman you insisted on talking to even though I told you not to. 

542
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:50,866
I didn't...

543
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:55,673
Your stubbornness is astounding to me. I asked you over and over to please refrain from talking to her.

544
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,478
- You asked me once, and... 
- But no, you had to push it,

545
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:01,546
- and now look what's happened! Are you happy? 
- Are you seriously blaming me for this?

546
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:04,762
- You had to talk to her! 
- I didn't have lunch with her, Mom. Dad did.

547
00:33:04,828 --> 00:33:09,133
I wouldn't have known! If you hadn't talked to her, I wouldn't have known, and everything would have been fine!

548
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:12,718
- So you'd rather just be in denial about things, Mom? 
- Everything would have been fine!

549
00:33:12,804 --> 00:33:15,594
But Dad still would have been having lunch with this woman once a year.

550
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:18,889
You weren't even supposed to come. It was supposed to be your father and me and Rory.

551
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,553
- You weren't supposed to come! 
- Okay!

552
00:33:25,133 --> 00:33:26,281
This is Jason Stiles.

553
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:31,023
- You still have those reservations? 
- Should I... no.

554
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:34,094
- Gonna let it go. I'll pick you up at eight. 
- Okay.

555
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:38,579
- And wear something completely evil. 
- So, horns, tail, and my Wolfowitz t-shirt?

556
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,181
- Perfect. 
- Bye.

557
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:52,731
Oh, man, this place is crazy.

558
00:33:52,843 --> 00:33:56,063
You know they flew in the top prostitutes from Hong Kong to work that coat check.

559
00:33:56,162 --> 00:34:00,805
Oh, God, I hope that's true. Okay, is there a star? We need a star.

560
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,655
- Bingo. 
- Where?

561
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:03,960
- Ted Koppel's here. 
- Where?

562
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:07,324
- Right there. 
- Oh, dear, so he really does look like that.

563
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:12,524
- The name is Stiles, for two. 
- I love that Ted Koppel's here.

564
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,644
Follow me.

565
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,071
- Look how she seats us right away. 
- You like that, huh?

566
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:23,001
I do like that. Now, if she seats us next to Ted, we have to make sure to become his best friends

567
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:26,293
- so he invites us to all those famous newscaster parties. 
- Oh, that sounds fabulous.

568
00:34:28,884 --> 00:34:32,068
- Miss? 
- Yes? Oh, me? Sorry. Thank you.

569
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:34,578
Thank you.

570
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:37,848
Your waiter will be in in a moment.

571
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:47,039
- Nice, huh? 
- Yes, very nice.

572
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:50,623
Quiet. You could hear a pin drop.

573
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:09,568
So, how are you feeling tonight? Red, white, or gin-soaked?

574
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:11,216
- Red's good. 
- Red it is.

575
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:15,389
- So, I'm sorry, is this where we're going to eat? 
- That's right.

576
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:16,752
Oh, okay.

577
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:21,840
- Did they run out of tables or something? 
- I requested this room.

578
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,064
- You requested it? 
- Yes.

579
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:25,860
- You asked for it on purpose? 
- Hey, it's very hard to get this room.

580
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:30,862
- Everybody wants it, and now we've got it. 
- Yes, we do, we have it. Lucky us.

581
00:35:33,745 --> 00:35:38,102
It's just that everything's kinda going on out there.

582
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:42,899
- So? 
- Don't you wanna be out there with everybody else?

583
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,948
- Why? 
- Because it's fun.

584
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:48,158
You know, all the people and the noise, you can't even hear yourself think.

585
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,913
But that's the point of coming to a place like this.

586
00:35:51,086 --> 00:35:54,639
I thought the point of coming to a place like this would be to enjoy the food and the atmosphere.

587
00:35:54,742 --> 00:35:57,896
Yes, but all of the atmosphere is out there.

588
00:35:59,672 --> 00:36:02,237
- You don't like the room. 
- No, it's...

589
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:09,166
it is weird, you know. I mean, the two of us sitting all alone in here.

590
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:12,647
I feel like we're quarantined. It's like the ebola room or something.

591
00:36:12,914 --> 00:36:15,207
Okay, I don't know what to do.

592
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:20,240
- Why don't we ask for a table out there? 
- Oh, no, the place is booked solid.

593
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,139
- We could eat at the bar. 
- I don't eat at the bar.

594
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,638
- Why not? 
- I don't like stools. Your feet hang.

595
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:27,623
Hey, this is a fancy place. Someone will hold them.

596
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:31,581
- Maybe we should just go. 
- Oh, Jason...

597
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:36,783
No, you're uncomfortable. It's fine. Let's go. Ted would.

598
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:54,913
We could go someplace else. You must be starving.

599
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,699
You know, I'm not. I had a lot of food today.

600
00:36:57,831 --> 00:37:01,661
Right, you tailgated. Okay, so, home?

601
00:37:02,997 --> 00:37:05,123
Okay, yeah, home's fine.

602
00:37:05,481 --> 00:37:08,721
- We could try this again some other time. 
- Absolutely.

603
00:37:12,388 --> 00:37:15,321
- Oh my God, I'm starving. 
- You just said you weren't.

604
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:18,342
- Well, I lied. 
- Well, good, 'cause I'm starving, too.

605
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:21,451
- Well, you should have said something. 
- Well, our date was dinner. It was implied.

606
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:24,527
- Oh, okay, next exit. 
- What?

607
00:37:24,614 --> 00:37:27,645
- Get off at the next exit, do it, do it. 
- Okay, doing it, doing it.

608
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:39,529
Oh, this place, hands down, the best tacos on the East Coast. You're gonna be very happy.

609
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,314
- Good to know. 
- Welcome to Taco Barn, may I take your order?

610
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:48,479
Hi. Um, two tacos, an order of taquitos, a beef burrito with no onions, and, don't bother bagging it,

611
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,448
- that'll just slow us down. Go ahead. 
- Nothing for me.

612
00:37:51,823 --> 00:37:53,901
- What? 
- No, nothing, thanks.

613
00:37:54,464 --> 00:37:58,346
- You said you were starving. 
- Yeah, I'm just not big on Mexican food.

614
00:37:58,453 --> 00:38:01,775
- Trust me, this stuff bears no resemblance to Mexican food. 
- It's okay, I'm good.

615
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:06,004
Okay. Well, I'm not gonna eat if you're not gonna eat.

616
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,720
- What is this, junior high? 
- No, no, I just...

617
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,397
- I don't wanna sit in a car and eat by myself. 
- Why?

618
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:14,849
- Because it's not fun. 
- Well, does everything have to be fun for you?

619
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:18,793
- When I'm on a date, yeah. 
- Oh, please, come on, just get the food.

620
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:22,307
- No, no, let's go. 
- No, the tacos. You love the tacos.

621
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,642
- I'm not hungry. 
- You are too hungry.

622
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,168
- Forget it. Let's go. 
- Okay, I'm going.

623
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:38,854
- I told you to get the tacos. 
- Let's not do this again, okay? I just need to eat something.

624
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,369
- This is a supermarket. 
- I'm gonna throw my purse at you.

625
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,774
- You have to cook anything you buy here. 
- Jason, come on.

626
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,101
- Come on what? 
- There are a million things here. 

627
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:51,763
There's cheese and fruit and chips and a whole prepared-food section. Now grab this basket and look.

628
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:53,749
- Do you want to start with the salad? 
- Okay.

629
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:00,461
- What did you just do? 
- I need razors.

630
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:02,653
- No, no, this is an errand. 
- So?

631
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:06,866
So we're looking for food and you're running errands.

632
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,001
I'm a busy man. I don't have time to do these things.

633
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:10,166
- We're on a date! 
- We're in a store, 

634
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:12,566
they're right there. Now I don't have to go tomorrow.

635
00:39:12,636 --> 00:39:16,481
But a date isn't about convenience. You're not supposed to be thinking about the things you need.

636
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,493
- Oh, shoot, I'm out of toothpaste. 
- Grab it.

637
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,446
- Where are you going? 
- I need hand soap.

638
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:27,879
All right. I'll grab some paper towels and meet you in the prepared-food section.

639
00:39:27,988 --> 00:39:30,958
- Fine. Which way is detergent? 
- That way.

640
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,762
- Hey, you need peas? 'Cause there's two for one. 
- No, I'm good.

641
00:39:40,008 --> 00:39:42,645
- I'm getting you a couple anyhow. 
- Where are you?

642
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,232
- Let's see, there's Jell-o and tiny cocktail wieners. 
- Oh, I'm one aisle over.

643
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:48,749
I'll be right there.

644
00:39:50,924 --> 00:39:54,380
Boy, I gotta tell you, the advice about not shopping hungry couldn't be truer.

645
00:39:54,468 --> 00:39:56,807
- Good Lord, that's a lot of food. 
- Well, it's not all just food.

646
00:39:56,947 --> 00:40:00,055
- So you won't eat fast food, but Sno Balls are okay? 
- I've never eaten them. I was curious.

647
00:40:00,183 --> 00:40:02,191
Sno Balls. Pink marshmallow coconut balls. 

648
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:04,791
You wouldn't be curious about pink marshmallow coconut balls?

649
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:09,843
Who makes these? How did the decision to dye the coconut pink occur? Why are they shaped like a chest?

650
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:12,542
Is there any dessert on the fact of the planet that could stimulate this much debate?

651
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:14,676
- I don't know. 
- What are you looking for?

652
00:40:14,774 --> 00:40:18,009
- Well, they usually have the mini size of these chips. 
- Get the big one.

653
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:19,824
I grab them on the way out of the house and this won't fit in my purse. 

654
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:22,024
Well, they must have them.

655
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,537
- Hold on a second. 
- Where are you going?

656
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:27,451
- Just watch my Sno Balls, please. 
- Not on the first date, mister.

657
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:32,997
Let's go.

658
00:40:33,673 --> 00:40:35,454
- Where? 
- Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

659
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:44,875
- Ten minutes. 
- That's all we need.

660
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,878
- What are we doing here? 
- We're looking for your chips.

661
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:51,930
- Seriously? 
- Well, this is where they keep the goods.

662
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,106
How did you get the guy to let us in the back room?

663
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:57,081
Talking people into doing things that they don't wanna do happens to be my specialty.

664
00:40:57,189 --> 00:41:00,511
Look, a time clock. Let's clock in. Do you wanna be Lucy or Jamal?

665
00:41:00,741 --> 00:41:04,059
Either one. What were the chips you like?

666
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:05,303
Sour cream and onion.

667
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:07,767
Ah, got 'em.

668
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:12,805
- Oh, it's just like heaven. 
- Here. Wanna do the honors?

669
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:18,109
- I feel so powerful. 
- Well, you're holding a knife. Being armed does that to people.

670
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:29,584
- Wow, Cap'n Crunch. I lived on Cap'n Crunch in college. 
- Cut him.

671
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:33,335
- Cut Cap'n Crunch? That seems a bit severe. 
- Trust me, he's got it coming.

672
00:41:33,873 --> 00:41:36,750
Okay, I just hope Jamal doesn't get busted for this.

673
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:42,221
- Mac and cheese? 
- Yeah, please, delicious.

674
00:41:43,094 --> 00:41:46,381
You know, I must say, this is a pretty nice spread we put together here.

675
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:50,145
- A little ingenuity. 
- It's too bad they stop selling alcohol after 9:30.

676
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,327
I mean, not that I need to be drunk to have dinner with you.

677
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:56,408
- Oh, the fun flask. 
- Excuse me?

678
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:59,197
I swiped the fun flask.

679
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:02,586
- So, tell me something. 
- Yes?

680
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:04,057
Why'd you change your mind?

681
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,377
- No reason. 
- You seemed to be pretty determined.

682
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:11,767
- Yes, I did. 
- And you had some pretty good logic backing you up.

683
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:12,868
I always do. 

684
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:17,968
So between the phone call where you said no and eight hours ago, what happened?

685
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,611
Well, I went to the Harvard-Yale game with Rory and my parents.

686
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:24,859
Yes, that's how I get all of my girls.

687
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:32,969
And there was this thing with my mother. And it just... well, she was just...

688
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:38,375
- I thought, and... so here we are? 
- So here we are.

689
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:45,606
Listen, whatever it is your mother did today, do you think she might do it again tomorrow night?

690
00:42:47,137 --> 00:42:49,338
I think there's an excellent possibility.

691
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:52,283
Okay, I'm gonna go for the giant egg rolls. Do you want one?

692
00:42:52,477 --> 00:42:54,899
- Yes, please, and don't forget the hot mustard. 
- Right.

693
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:59,563
- Hello? 
- So how was it?

694
00:42:59,686 --> 00:43:01,873
- It's still going on. 
- Really, how dirty.

695
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:05,194
- We're at the West Hills market drinking booze out of paper cups. 
- Really, how pathetic.

696
00:43:05,295 --> 00:43:08,676
- He made sure I got my potato chips. 
- Really, how confusing.

697
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:12,348
- I'll explain later. How are the grandparents? 
- Not speaking.

698
00:43:12,476 --> 00:43:14,759
- Must have been one hell of a game. 
- I read.

699
00:43:14,897 --> 00:43:17,980
- I'm sorry I bailed. 
- You owe me nothing but the gory details.

700
00:43:18,068 --> 00:43:19,006
I might like him. 

701
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:22,896
Just remember, you're sleeping with every single person he's ever slept with.

702
00:43:23,043 --> 00:43:25,153
- Thank you for that. 
- Call me tomorrow.

703
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:26,285
You got it.
