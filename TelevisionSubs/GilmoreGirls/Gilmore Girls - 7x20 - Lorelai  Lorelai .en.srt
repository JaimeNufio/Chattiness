1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,570
Although getting soviet support for his

2
00:00:01,571 --> 00:00:04,039
war in the pacific was his top priority

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,287
many historians have argued
that it was actually Roosevelt's

4
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:11,198
declining health that played
the most significant role at Yalta.

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,769
Had he not been in such
failing health, they argue,

6
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,524
he would have driven a much harder bargain with

7
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:17,725
Stalin during those fateful negotiations.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,235
- For Churchill�
- Excuse me Mrs O�Malley.

9
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:21,280
Excuse me, please.

10
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:31,063
Rory Gilmore, there's been a mistake.

11
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,993
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,113
And take your things with
you. You won't be coming back.

13
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:37,195
What?

14
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:38,970
Come on. Quickly.

15
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,699
But?

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,072
Mom, I had the most awful day

17
00:01:01,736 --> 00:01:05,575
Hi. I thought I would miss you.

18
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:06,545
Where are you going?

19
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:08,341
Well, I'm going to Hawaii

20
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:08,735
Hawaii?

21
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,154
Yeah. Hawaii

22
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:10,431
Why?

23
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:11,363
'Cause I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.

24
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:12,140
I didn't know that

25
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,370
Yes, well

26
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:14,566
Well, when are you coming back?

27
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,405
I don't now.
How many ounces can you take on the pLane?

28
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:17,541
Two, Three I forget.

29
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,009
Mum, I really need to talk

30
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:19,922
Plane.

31
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:21,861
Well how am I gonna be
able to get in touch with you?

32
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:23,111
You can't. I need a break, kid.

33
00:01:23,112 --> 00:01:25,149
Take it easy. Try not to kill any plants

34
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:36,475
Salman wants to come over for dinner this weekend.

35
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:38,519
Is he bringing that boring wife of his?

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,115
Padma is fine.

37
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:42,714
Cookbooks, Doyle. Her
husband wrote "The Satanic Verses,"

38
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:44,309
and all you'd want to talk about is cookbooks.

39
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,476
I like "Top Chef."

40
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:47,537
Fine, but I'm on call all this weekend,

41
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:49,524
so here's hoping for a heart transplant.

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,882
- I finally had to fire Broder.
- Really?

43
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:53,838
He knew it was coming, but still...

44
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:56,096
Well being Executive Editor of the Washington Post

45
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:59,863
does have its drawbacks.
oh! hi Rory

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,268
hi

47
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:02,540
What are you doing here?

48
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:04,621
This is my house

49
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:06,560
Rory, we've been through this.

50
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:11,003
It will always be your house
in your heart, but we own it now

51
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:12,081
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:12,082 --> 00:02:13,079
You need money, kid?

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,456
No, at least,I don't think I do

54
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:17,119
Here

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,804
what are you doing?

56
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,130
Don�t think of it as charity.

57
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:22,108
Think of it as a gift -- a charitable gift.

58
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:22,866
But

59
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:23,867
You better get going.

60
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,595
Yeah you don�t want to be late.

61
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:26,264
For what?

62
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:27,330
Uh, work?

63
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:29,925
Oh, and don�t forget your poker.

64
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:31,831
That trash isn't gonna pick up itself.

65
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,479
Subtitle by Maglori

66
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,761
I'm in better shape than I was before the heart attack.

67
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:48,741
Well you do look great, dad. Very Lance Armstrong.

68
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:49,401
what do you think hon?

69
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:50,523
You look great, grandpa.

70
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:52,354
Ah lost 11 pounds

71
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,610
You can tell. You're super-ripped under that jacket.

72
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,533
Well I've gotten into a good routine with the exercise,

73
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:58,578
and now I can't imagine a day without it.

74
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,772
Yeah grandma better keep
an eye on you over at the club.

75
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,428
Eh Rory, I'm so sorry
that Logan couldn't join us tonight.

76
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:07,248
Oh he was, too, but all his
meetings in California have been going so well,

77
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:08,671
he decided to extend his trip.

78
00:04:08,672 --> 00:04:09,684
Good job prospects?

79
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:12,362
I think so. He's making a lot of great contacts.

80
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:14,054
Well, next time.

81
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,282
So, when do finals start?

82
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:19,998
Uh, tomorrow, actually. Irony from Milton to Byron

83
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,264
- ha
- I hope we're not keeping you from your studies.

84
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:24,477
Oh, no. It was so nice to get a break

85
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:25,685
from being in that library all day.

86
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,922
Actually It's nice to talk above a whisper.

87
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,215
Well, your grandfather
and I have a little surprise for you.

88
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:33,508
- Uh-oh.
- what?

89
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,890
- Did you name another building after her?
- NO

90
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:38,908
No I know I know, you
bought Yale and named it Rory.

91
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:42,241
From now on, the Ivy League is
going to be Harvard, Princeton, and Rory.

92
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:44,284
- Has a nice sound, though.
- A nice ring to it.

93
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,054
"Hey, I'll meet you at the Rory/Harvard game."

94
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:48,247
Your grandfather and I have decided to

95
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:51,052
purchase a little Pied-Terre in the city.

96
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:54,143
Nothing fancy. Just a little
two-bedroom on the Upper East Side.

97
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:54,892
That's exciting.

98
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,464
Now we realize that the Upper East Side is not

99
00:04:57,465 --> 00:05:00,428
the most convenient address
for an employee of the New York Times,

100
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,703
but it's just a 20-minute cab ride to work.

101
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:04,683
You're giving her an apartment, mom?

102
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:07,241
No. It'll be our apartment but Rory's to live in.

103
00:05:07,242 --> 00:05:09,612
Of course we would never drop by unannounced.

104
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,238
Well, that goes without saying.

105
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:13,474
We would just come in on the occasional weekend

106
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:14,735
and maybe stay over some nights

107
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:15,992
when we're going to be in the city late.

108
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:18,682
Hear that, honey?
You and grandma are gonna be roomies.

109
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:19,683
So, what do you think?

110
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:22,129
Oh It's a very generous offer.

111
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,965
Oh, we're glad to do it.

112
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:27,020
But I don't know if I'm actually gonna be moving

113
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:28,238
to New York after I graduate.

114
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,773
I didn't get the internship at the New York Times.

115
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:32,534
- what?
- you didn'?

116
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:33,679
That's terrible.

117
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,775
When did you find that out?

118
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,394
Um, yesterday. It's not a big deal.

119
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:42,745
Well, this is preposterous.
Who could be more qualified than you?

120
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:45,329
and they only take a couple of people, so...

121
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:45,329
Well the Reston fellowship is very competitive,

122
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:46,114
This is outrageous.

123
00:05:46,115 --> 00:05:48,739
You rose to editor in chief of the Yale Daily News.

124
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,696
What else do they want,
an exclusive interview with Osama Bin Laden?

125
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:53,928
Why didn't you tell me?

126
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:57,080
'Cause I just found out,
and I was so busy studying for finals.

127
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,402
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

128
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,207
Oh, it's okay. I'm just,
as I said, trying to put it behind me.

129
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:04,774
I'm sure it's nepotism.

130
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:06,279
If your name isn't Keller or Sulzberger,

131
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,799
you may as well not even apply.

132
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,947
Oh, grandma, it's okay, I promise. Um actually,

133
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:13,399
I need to get back to Yale soon to keep studying,

134
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,022
and I'm kind of hungry -- could we eat?

135
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:17,055
Yeah, let's get dinner started. Mom? Dad?

136
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:21,039
Well yes, let's eat. I'll have
Alexandra serve the salads at once.

137
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,195
Hi, hon, it's me. Just calling to check in

138
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:30,746
and wish you luck this
morning. I know it's your first final,

139
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:33,235
and I know you're gonna knock their socks off or

140
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:35,503
their bow ties or
whatever it is you knock off professors

141
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:36,729
when you're trying to impress them.

142
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,610
Call me when you're done. I love you. Bye.

143
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,446
�My funny valentine�
it doesn�t work, it�s April already.

144
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:43,989
What about �Down with love� to open.

145
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,516
open It�s too depressing.

146
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:49,071
It�s not depressing, it�s ironic.

147
00:06:49,072 --> 00:06:52,184
People don�t listen to music for irony.

148
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:54,656
- What about �Weird Al�
- Weird who?

149
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:57,316
- Hi girls.
-  Lorelai.
- Hi hon.

150
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:57,811
What�s with the whisper?

151
00:06:57,812 --> 00:06:59,127
We�re saving our voices

152
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,468
I think that ship has sailed.

153
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,852
Oh we�re debuting our
cabaret act tonight at KC�s.

154
00:07:03,853 --> 00:07:06,401
OH I thought Saturdays
was karaoke night at KC�s.

155
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:07,916
It is so we went over there this morning

156
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:10,435
to sign our selves up for the first 15 songs.

157
00:07:10,436 --> 00:07:12,501
Well I�m sure the karaoke regulars will love that.

158
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:15,364
So what do you think
Lorelai, to open with the show.

159
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:17,708
Streisand or Porter?

160
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,416
You can not go wrong with either one.

161
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:20,730
You gonna be there right.

162
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:25,989
You gotta come hon, it�s
gonna be fantastic�  Fantastic.

163
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,009
- Hey
- Hey

164
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,392
Okay her you go ladies.
Little hot water for you Miss Patty

165
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:32,774
and for you Babette a bowl of shredded wheat.

166
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:35,571
It�s for my throat, it give it a rougher quality,

167
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:39,648
a husk sound sorta like
Debbie Herry meets Eithal Herman.

168
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:40,948
- What?
- What?
- What?

169
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:41,749
- Nothing.
- Okay.

170
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,484
I�m just getting some coffee.

171
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:43,485
- To go.
- Yeah.

172
00:07:43,486 --> 00:07:44,376
Coming right up.

173
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,590
- Oh you preparing for the big boat trip huh.
-Yeap.

174
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,752
- Wow you want me just to talk in nautical terms till you go.

175
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:54,827
- No.
-  Eye, eye captain.

176
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:56,266
- Please don�t.
- Shiver me timbers.

177
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,004
Are you done.

178
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:58,250
All hands on deck. Now I�m done.

179
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:58,894
Good.

180
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,803
So where you going?

181
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,678
Ah we�re thinking of heading up the coast.

182
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,001
Oh up is good.

183
00:08:03,002 --> 00:08:04,002
Should be fine.

184
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:06,775
You're really going on a boat
trip, you sure that's a good idea.

185
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:07,688
What's wring with a boat trip?

186
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,453
- Well for starters you're on a boat.
- so

187
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,445
So, anything could go wrong,

188
00:08:11,446 --> 00:08:13,346
you're on a boat in the middle of no where,

189
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:16,716
haven't you seen "Dead
Calm" "Open Water" "Das Boot".

190
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:19,623
Okay first of all I did not purchase a U boat.

191
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,638
Titanic, surely you've seen Titanic!

192
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,670
Aprils very excited about this.

193
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,589
sure she is

194
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,342
Here's your coffee.

195
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:26,935
Look instead of paying for this can

196
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:28,460
I just give you some of my stage advice.

197
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:29,711
I'd rather have the dollar.

198
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,795
April says she's very excited.

199
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:33,050
Very excited.

200
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:34,358
Yeah she says she's very excited,

201
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:37,757
but if I were you I would
plan a couple of nights at a hotel

202
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:40,302
so she can wash her hair and order room service.

203
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:41,776
- That's what I would do .
- Okay.

204
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:43,733
Okay, and if you're heading
up the coast you have to spend

205
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,596
as much time as possible on
the southern coast of Maine.

206
00:08:45,597 --> 00:08:46,141
Yeah.

207
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:48,220
And you have to go to a
place called Barnacle Billies.

208
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:49,134
"Barnacle Billies"

209
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,578
The best lobster you have every had

210
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,528
and you sit on the deck and never want to leave.

211
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:54,435
Okay I'll check it out.

212
00:08:55,136 --> 00:08:56,930
For all that extra advice don't I get a donut?

213
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:59,390
- Thank you very much.
- Mu-mm

214
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,209
Bye Patty, bye Babette.

215
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,224
So long, farewell. Auf weidersehen goodbye, goodbye.

216
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,249
Hey.

217
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,930
Hey, Rory. Everybody, 
this is my roommate, Rory.

218
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:20,596
Rory, this is Elise, 
Karen, Robin, Tim, and Edwin.

219
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,554
All fellow Yale seniors and

220
00:09:24,555 --> 00:09:26,662
all recently accepted 
into Harvard Medical school.

221
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:28,405
Oh, wow. Congratulations

222
00:09:28,806 --> 00:09:31,285
Thank you! Thank you.

223
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:32,802
When word spread 
around campus about who got in,

224
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:34,359
we decided to get together and celebrate.

225
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,508
Cool.

226
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:39,011
A good chance to size up
 the competition. I know robin, 

227
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:41,920
Karen, and Edwin from 
ORGO, and I'm comfortable that 

228
00:09:41,921 --> 00:09:43,357
when the time comes, I can crush them. 

229
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:44,855
Elise and Tim are new to me, 

230
00:09:44,856 --> 00:09:46,323
but Elise's hand was shaking a little 

231
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:47,331
when she was cutting into the cake, 

232
00:09:47,332 --> 00:09:49,758
so I've got her pegged 
for an early exit into podiatry.

233
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,893
Sounds like quite a party.

234
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:52,875
It really is. 
Do you want some cake?

235
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:55,380
Oh. Definitely not.

236
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:56,945
We tried to get a corpse cake, 

237
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,996
but we couldn't find a 
bakery that would make us one, 

238
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:02,265
so we had to settle for a naked-guy
cake from an erotic bakery in Hartford.

239
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,124
Yes it's a little early for cake for me.

240
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,394
It actually tastes pretty good once 

241
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,254
you get past the pornographic-dessert issue. 

242
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:09,244
Sure I can't interest you in a fibula?

243
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:10,245
No, thanks.

244
00:10:10,246 --> 00:10:12,901
Here's your mail. You got a 
letter from the Chicago Sun-Times.

245
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:23,460
Oh. Great. 
They're not hiring.

246
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:26,415
Bummer. You okay?

247
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,649
Yeah. I'm fine. It's not a big deal.

248
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:31,343
You want to hang out, have a little champagne?

249
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:33,641
 I could use an extra pair of eyes out here.

250
00:10:33,642 --> 00:10:36,111
I would, but I have a final in one hour,

251
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:38,032
 so I'm gonna go shower
 and close my eyes for a bit.

252
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,497
Sure. We'll try to keep it down.

253
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,457
Okay. Thanks. Nice meeting you, everyone.

254
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,678
- Bye, Rory.
- Bye!

255
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:10,185
Hi. Um, I'm calling for
 Kate Hessel? Rory Gilmore.

256
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:19,661
 Okay�.Hello, Kate? Um, 
hi. This is Rory Gilmore. Good.

257
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:23,940
 I'm well. How are you?
 Um, yeah, finals and everything. 

258
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:25,857
It's just really crazy right now. 

259
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:31,001
But, um, the reason
 why I was calling is, uh, well,

260
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:33,456
 I know that initially
 I said that I wasn't interested

261
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:35,315
 in the job at the
 providence journal-bulletin, 

262
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:39,156
but I was thinking about 
it, and it's such a great job. 

263
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,250
It's such a wonderful 
opportunity that I was wondering 

264
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:47,248
if maybe�no. Right.
 Of course you did. No.

265
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,864
 It's such a great job. 
I mean, of course you've already,

266
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:56,603
 uh, filled the position. 
I just thought I would, uh, check

267
00:11:56,604 --> 00:12:00,718
�that I would call 
just in case. Well, thanks.

268
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:22,429
- Hey.
- Hey! Taste.

269
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,525
- What?
- Taste.

270
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,263
- Oh, it's a meatball.
- So good.

271
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,044
It's 9:00 A.M.

272
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,706
Look It's amazing. I completely forgot

273
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,552
 how pregnancy scrambles my taste buds. 

274
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:32,443
I swear, it doesn't even taste like a meatball.

275
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:33,481
Does it taste like a Danish?

276
00:12:33,482 --> 00:12:38,377
Well okay, then, for lunch. So?

277
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:41,600
So...I went into Luke's diner this morning, 

278
00:12:41,601 --> 00:12:43,883
and he was wearing the hat I gave him.

279
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:45,539
You gave Luke a hat.

280
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,708
No, not recently. 
Years ago -- for Christmas.

281
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:48,854
Oh, yeah, the blue hat.

282
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:52,369
Yes, the blue hat. 
And he hasn't worn it since we broke up, 

283
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,997
I mean not once. I don't 
blame him. It's totally understandable.

284
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:57,537
Oh, yeah, you're right. 
He wears that black hat now.

285
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:59,734
 It gives him a slightly more menacing quality.

286
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,944
But then suddenly today, I walk into the diner, 

287
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:05,040
- and there it is, atop his head.
- Atop.

288
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,110
Yes, atop his head. 
What do you think that means?

289
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,637
-It's good.
-Good how?

290
00:13:08,938 --> 00:13:11,737
 Well, you know, he's past
 his pain, you're talking again, 

291
00:13:11,738 --> 00:13:14,244
you've cleared the air, 
you're coming into the diner again, 

292
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:16,316
and, you know, he's wearing your hat.

293
00:13:16,517 --> 00:13:19,518
Yeah. That's nice, right?
 I should probably reciprocate.

294
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,350
Reciprocate?

295
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,535
Yeah, you know he's doing something friendly. 

296
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,450
I should probably do something friendly back 

297
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,136
-- wear my own hat, as it were.

298
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,659
Did he give you a hat?

299
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,810
No, that's the problem.

300
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,369
Did he give you any 
friendship thing you can wear?

301
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,911
No, you know, I got
 rid of all my Luke-related stuff.

302
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:34,934
Oh.

303
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:36,125
We've made such progress lately. 

304
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:39,094
You know I don't want to leave
 his hat gesture unacknowledged.

305
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:42,038
Hey, you could always throw on a flannel shirt.

306
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,242
That's a good idea.

307
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,608
God, are you sure you don't want to try this?

308
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:47,928
 What if I scrambled it with some eggs?

309
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:52,870
-No.
-Really? Mmm!

310
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,093
-Hey.
-Hi.

311
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:14,930
Are they both down?

312
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:17,629
Yes. Three choruses of "Nappy Nappy Time Time" 

313
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,277
and 20 minutes of Rhythmic Shooshing, .

314
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,143
and they both conked out. 

315
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:21,681
Kwan fought it a little harder than Steve did, 

316
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:23,632
- but they're both really tired
- Good work.

317
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:27,557
I don't know what to do first -- sleep or eat. Eat!

318
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:29,741
- Hi.
- Hi!

319
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,262
So they didn't have those potato rolls you like,

320
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:35,927
 so I got the hamburger rolls which
 most closely resembled the potato rolls. 

321
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:36,959
I checked the ingredients, 

322
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,640
and potatoes aren't actually listed in there.

323
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:41,113
 But are potato rolls made from actual potatoes, 

324
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,408
or is that just an 
expression like "finger sandwiches"?

325
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,206
- Um, Zach?
- Yeah? 

326
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,290
Name-brand diapers and, 
oh, name-brand chips? Are you crazy?

327
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,684
I just thought I'd splurge a little.

328
00:14:51,685 --> 00:14:53,241
We are on a budget.

329
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,793
I know, but I got amazing news in the store. 

330
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,363
This is the only way I could think to celebrate.

331
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:58,145
What news?

332
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,321
Okay. You ready?

333
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:02,474
 I was in the frozen-foods aisle 
when I get this call from Graham. 

334
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:03,234
You remember graham.

335
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,105
From vapor rub? 

336
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,119
Yeah we saw them play
last year at the mercury lounge.

337
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,844
Yeah well, great news. 

338
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:10,208
Their lead guitarist got
 into this wicked car accident, 

339
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,581
which isn't the great part, clearly.

340
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:14,011
 He's gonna be fine, but 
the use of his right hand is pretty iffy. 

341
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:16,713
Anyway, they need a
 new guitarist, and they called me.

342
00:15:16,714 --> 00:15:18,455
- Lead guitarist?
- Lead guitarist.

343
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:19,479
- For vapor rub?
- I know.

344
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,696
Oh my God I want to yell,
 but I don't want to wake the babies. 

345
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:22,627
I'm yelling on the inside.

346
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:24,367
They're going on a 2-month tour this summer, 

347
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:25,535
and they want me to join them.

348
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:26,234
I can't believe it.

349
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,928
Graham talked me through 
the whole thing, It's the perfect setup. 

350
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,335
8 weeks, 25 cities, 40 shows.

351
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:33,216
 The whole thing's already practically sold out, 

352
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:34,438
and they have this awesome tour bus. 

353
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,245
And they're cool with
 you and the boys coming along, 

354
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:38,176
'cause I said, "I can't go
 if I can't bring the family,"

355
00:15:38,177 --> 00:15:40,135
 and he talked to the band aand they were into it.

356
00:15:40,136 --> 00:15:40,898
Seriously?

357
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,481
Yeah one guy's bringing his girlfriend. 

358
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:44,242
The bassist has a puppy. It's totally cool.

359
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,910
Right now, I am howling at the top of my lungs.

360
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:49,108
Just wait. When we're in Philly and D.C., 

361
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:50,974
We're gonna be opening for Tokyo Police Club.

362
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:53,210
Foot stomping, so much 
foot stomping happening here!

363
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,446
Yeah the bands are really tight.

364
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:56,736
 We're playing at the 930 club, the Black Cat,

365
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:57,846
 and the first Unitarian, 

366
00:15:57,847 --> 00:16:00,382
and we don't even have to bring our own backline.

367
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:01,140
Shut up!

368
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:03,669
Graham's always been a big fan of my songwriting, 

369
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,591
and he said he'd totally 
give my new stuff a listen.

370
00:16:06,317 --> 00:16:09,159
So many people are gonna 
see you play -- I mean, a real tour.

371
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,274
And it's a million times better 
than that Seventh-Day Adventist tour. 

372
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:15,052
We get to stay in actual
 motel rooms, not church basements, 

373
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:16,590
and we don't have to run our lyrics past 

374
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:17,955
the church elders before every show.

375
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,622
I am so proud of you, Zach. 
Now let's pop open the name-brand chips!

376
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,189
You want to wake the babies and tell them?

377
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,633
Do it and die.

378
00:16:51,920 --> 00:17:03,400
Rory! Rory? Honey?

379
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:05,879
- Yeah?
- Hi.
- Hey.

380
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,136
Whatcha doing?

381
00:17:08,137 --> 00:17:11,455
- Hiding.
- From...
- The world.

382
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,767
What's going on?
 Want to talk about it?

383
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,881
I tanked it.

384
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,020
What did you tank?

385
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:18,977
My final.

386
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,596
Oh, I'm sure you didn't tank it.

387
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:22,562
I'm pretty sure I did.

388
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:23,496
Why?

389
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:25,169
'Cause I didn't even turn in all of it.

390
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,857
Oh, sweetie.

391
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,853
If I didn't fail it, I didn't do better than a "C"... 

392
00:17:28,854 --> 00:17:34,289
or a C-minus... or a "D." Oh, what if I got a "d"?

393
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,461
Well, that's okay.

394
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,556
No, it's not. I mean I knew my stuff you know. 

395
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,450
The questions were exactly what I anticipated. 

396
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:44,771
I could have written about 
"Paradise Lost" for hours in those blue books, 

397
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,724
but halfway through the third blue book,

398
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,988
 I just started thinking, "what is the point?

399
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:50,308
 I'm never gonna get a job, anyway."

400
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:52,010
Not true -- you are gonna get a job.

401
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,244
I'm not. The New York Times doesn't want me. 

402
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,629
I got a letter from the 
Chicago Sun-Times. They're not hiring.

403
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,967
 I even called the Providence Journal-Bulletin 

404
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:00,098
and begged for that job, 

405
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:01,319
but they already gave it to someone else, 

406
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,587
some non-idiot who didn't think 
they were too good and turn it down.

407
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,921
You're not an idiot.

408
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:08,282
I am. Everyone's probably laughing at me. 

409
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:10,430
I can probably never show 
my face in Providence again.

410
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:11,574
I think you probably can.

411
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,270
Not without hearing the snickers

412
00:18:13,271 --> 00:18:15,479
 and the people pointing 
and laughing at the unemployed,

413
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,720
 homeless Yale dropout.

414
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:20,468
Honey, you had a 
setback, and that is really terrible, 

415
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:22,526
but you are so smart and so talented. 

416
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:26,204
And there is some paper
 out there that is gonna hire 

417
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,810
you as their future superstar. That's just a fact.

418
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:29,404
Yeah, right.

419
00:18:29,405 --> 00:18:30,942
Look I think you're having a meltdown, 

420
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,882
so it's good you came home, 
because it's sad and disappointing, 

421
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:35,621
and everyone needs to 
have a meltdown once in a while. 

422
00:18:35,622 --> 00:18:36,738
I speak from experience.

423
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,037
-Ugh.
- When is your next final?

424
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:40,235
Not for another four days.

425
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:42,975
Well see? That gives you plenty of time to melt.

426
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,093
This is all your fault, you know?

427
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:45,642
Why?

428
00:18:45,643 --> 00:18:47,229
Because you told me I could do anything.

429
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,465
You can.

430
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:49,530
Apparently, I can't, 

431
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,309
and I have two rejection letters and

432
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,916
 a humiliating phone call to prove it. 

433
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,344
Do you know what the worst part of this is? 

434
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:57,069
I thought I was so in at the Times.

435
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,667
 I was just saying that I wasn't gonna get it. 

436
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:02,143
I was trying to be humble, but I was so not humble. 

437
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,540
I was so cocky. 
I was picturing myself working there

438
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,402
chatting up Bill Keller in the elevator and 

439
00:19:07,403 --> 00:19:09,440
running down the street
 for a quick lunch with Maureen Dowd 

440
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,534
and filing my first story 
and seeing my first byline. 

441
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:15,673
I already had the outfit picked 
out for my New York Times picture I.D.

442
00:19:15,674 --> 00:19:17,165
The new suit with the red theory shirt.

443
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,850
Yeah. And now I have to 
tell everyone that I didn't get it. 

444
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:20,532
And I don't want too. 

445
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,345
Just telling grandma and
 grandpa made me feel ashamed and

446
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:25,767
 humiliated all over again, 
which is why I didn't tell you. 

447
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:29,613
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 
It just sucks disappointing everyone.

448
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,473
Honey... you could
 never disappoint me -- ever.

449
00:19:36,245 --> 00:19:38,911
- Yeah?
- Ever, ever.

450
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:42,055
- Yeah.
-Ever.

451
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,344
Have you seen Steve's Paci?

452
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:49,100
His what?

453
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:52,203
His pacifier. It's green. 
He loses his mind without it. 

454
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:53,169
Can you check by the sink? 

455
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,052
I need to make a list of stuff to take on tour.

456
00:19:57,553 --> 00:20:00,038
Definitely. Zach says they're gonna be playing 

457
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,492
the Bowery and Roseland.

458
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,760
- Yep.
- Insane.
- Insane!

459
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:07,658
I can't wait to see those shows. 
And opening for Tokyo Police Club?

460
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:09,503
- And maybe Grizzly Bear.
- Really?

461
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:11,670
Yeah I know, he got that call like an hour ago. 


462
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:12,822
The whole thing is crazy.

463
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:14,728
-  Uh-oh.
- What?

464
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:15,650
Do you smell that?

465
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,220
Well, that's one way to find out.

466
00:20:18,221 --> 00:20:20,680
Oh, man. I just changed him. 

467
00:20:20,681 --> 00:20:23,630
Can you put Steve in 
the stroller? I'll change Kwan.

468
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:27,664
Got it. 
You know, their drummer's a bit of a lush.

469
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,480
- Who?
- Vapor Rub.

470
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,984
Oh, right. I know. Zach says
 he's, like, sober two hours a day.

471
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:35,827
I'm just saying, one night that guy's 

472
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:36,726
not gonna be able to go on. 

473
00:20:36,727 --> 00:20:37,657
You're gonna be waiting in the wings, 

474
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:39,311
and -- boom -- you're 
their new full-time drummer.

475
00:20:39,312 --> 00:20:43,118
Wouldn't that be something? 
Oh, man. You're kidding me. 

476
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,784
- What?
- False alarm.

477
00:20:45,785 --> 00:20:46,973
- Oh.
- What?

478
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:49,546
Steve is now emitting a very foul odor.

479
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:54,672
Oh� Bring him back. 
Oh, no, no. It's okay, Kwan. 

480
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:56,343
Just a false alarm. I am sorry. 

481
00:20:56,344 --> 00:21:01,503
Just getting you dressed again. 
It's okay. He hates getting naked.

482
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,308
You want his pacifier?

483
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,264
It's okay. No, that's Steve's. Kwan's is, uh, red.

484
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,672
Got it. Uh-oh.

485
00:21:10,673 --> 00:21:14,473
It's okay, Steve. He's coming 
right back. Maybe you should hold him.

486
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,603
- Sure thing.
- Until I'm ready to change him.

487
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:19,946
Sure thing. I hope the 
tour bus comes equipped with a nanny.

488
00:21:20,247 --> 00:21:23,314
Yeah, right. You want to come -- full-time "Manny"?

489
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:27,243
I wouldn't last a day. 
I don't know how you do it, Lane.

490
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,576
Yeah, it's a lot.
 My mom's actually been a huge help.

491
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,341
Maybe you should take her with you.

492
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:36,148
Yeah. Right. 
I'm sure I'll be fine.

493
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:37,506
Yeah, definitely. 

494
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:39,606
Zach says the bassist's girlfriend is coming along,

495
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:40,937
 so, hopefully, she'll be good with kids.

496
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,303
Yeah, hopefully.

497
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,410
Alanis Morissette.

498
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:47,494
- What? No.
- Yes.

499
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,202
But she was successful right from the start.

500
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:53,726
In Canada. She was on "Star Search." She dated Dave Coulier. 

501
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:55,871
She struggled a lot before "Jagged Little Pill."

502
00:21:55,872 --> 00:21:57,168
I don't think that's a good example.

503
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:58,483
- Jackson Pollock.
- Mom.

504
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,494
He struggled before he 
succeeded, and I bet if you asked him now, 

505
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:02,895
he would tell you he was glad for that.

506
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:03,943
Jackson Pollock is dead.

507
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:06,614
Yes, and from heaven he 
would tell you he was glad about that,

508
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:09,209
 because god rewards those who struggle.

509
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,749
Okay, mom, I get it. Setbacks make you stronger.

510
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,796
A setback is really just a 
set-up for future accomplishment. 

511
00:22:15,097 --> 00:22:16,224
How's your mac and cheese?

512
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:18,059
It's not having its usual effect.

513
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,230
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

514
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,563
You know I'm not just saying
 this stuff. I really do believe it.

515
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:24,295
I know you do mum.

516
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:26,090
And I think you've had kind of an easy time. 

517
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:28,579
I mean most of the things
 you've gone for you've gotten.

518
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,002
 This setback might
 help you have some perspective.

519
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:31,831
 I guess.

520
00:22:33,207 --> 00:22:35,327
Do you want some French 
toast? I think Caesar made it today. 

521
00:22:35,328 --> 00:22:36,508
It has extra brown sugar.

522
00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:41,050
- No, thanks.
Mark Twain.
- Hmm?

523
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:43,931
Well Mark Twain had to work
 as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi 

524
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:45,513
before he became a successful writer. 

525
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:46,685
And If he'd never had that experience, 

526
00:22:46,686 --> 00:22:47,901
he never would have written "Huckleberry Finn."

527
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,746
Which is one of your favorite books.

528
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:51,768
 Remember when I made you have my 12th birthday 

529
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,027
at the mark twain museum in Hartford?

530
00:22:53,428 --> 00:22:54,585
I thought one day I was gonna find you

531
00:22:54,586 --> 00:22:56,383
 on a raft made out of empty milk cartons, 

532
00:22:56,384 --> 00:22:58,080
sailing down the Housatonic river.

533
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,043
- It's Logan.
- Go ahead.
- Go outside. 



534
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:05,110
Hi. I'm okay.

535
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,436
How's she holding up?

536
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:14,900
Oh, she's okay. Rory's
 used to getting what Rory wants

537
00:23:14,901 --> 00:23:17,054
Yeah? I know. How you doing?

538
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:20,075
- Me? I'm fine.
- Yeah?

539
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,289
How's the, uh, trip-planning coming?

540
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,926
Great. Great, I actually took your suggestion 

541
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:28,326
and booked a couple hotels 
along the Maine coast -- Kittery, 

542
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:32,671
York harbor. You know nothing
 fancy, just cable TV and a hot shower.

543
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,304
That's great. I think she'll really love that.

544
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:37,656
I even made a reservation at Barnacle Billy's.

545
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,565
Bring me a "to go" box.

546
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:42,565
Will do. You know, I'm getting pretty excited. 

547
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:43,958
It's still a couple months away, 

548
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,669
but the trip is really coming together. You know.

549
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,126
 It's a lot of time on the water,

550
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:49,720
 and we're gonna cover 
a lot of ground, but it's six weeks, 

551
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,924
so I think, overall, it 
probably won't seem like so much.

552
00:23:52,694 --> 00:23:53,512
That sounds great. 

553
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,990
Hey, Rory and I are gonna go see,

554
00:23:57,991 --> 00:24:00,878
 Um Patty and Babette's act at 
K.C.'S tonight. It should be a hoot.

555
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:03,497
You know, not really my thing.

556
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,897
Yeah. No. I'm not saying�

557
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:06,684
No, I know.

558
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:08,523
Just we're going, but, you know.

559
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:09,699
Well, if I have some free time�

560
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,362
No, no, no.

561
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:11,353
Order up, Luke!

562
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:12,644
- I should probably.
- Yeah.

563
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:13,863
Can I get you anything else?

564
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:14,879
A doggie bag.

565
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,768
I'll take care of it.

566
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:16,351
Okay.

567
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,843
So, when are you coming back?

568
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:21,477
Soon.

569
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:24,501
How soon? It's been too long. 
You have to leave them wanting more.

570
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:26,572
I'm booked on a red-eye tonight. But we'll see, 

571
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:27,524
I have another meeting this afternoon. 

572
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:28,756
If these guys want to do dinner,

573
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:30,764
 drinks or something I may
 not have a choice. I'm sorry.

574
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:33,100
That's okay. I'm just glad it's going well. 

575
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:34,236
Think they're gonna make you an offer?

576
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:35,618
I don't know it's hard to tell, 

577
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:37,296
these guys play things pretty close to the vest.

578
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:38,271
Well I'm sure they will. 

579
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:39,727
All this time they're keeping you out there  

580
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,684
it can't just be because
 of your good looks and charm.

581
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:42,311
I hope not.

582
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,030
Well, I guess I better let you go.

583
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:46,738
Okay. I love you.

584
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:47,576
I love you, too.

585
00:24:48,077 --> 00:24:50,960
And, hey, don't worry about
 the Times or the final or any of it.

586
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:52,330
 I have a feeling, in the next couple days, 

587
00:24:52,331 --> 00:24:54,082
you will have moved on and forgotten all about this.

588
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:55,762
I don't know.

589
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:58,117
Things will be looking up, I promise.

590
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:00,408
Call me later?

591
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:02,548
- I will.
- Okay. Bye.

592
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,194
- Hey.
- Hey. How's the left coast?

593
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,392
He sounds good, very positive.

594
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:15,881
Good. You ready to go shopping?

595
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:18,181
Yes, there's nothing I love 
more than shopping after a huge meal.

596
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,713
- Lets go.
- Bye, Luke.

597
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:20,470
Take care, Rory.

598
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:21,606
Luke changed his hat.

599
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:22,206
Did he?

600
00:25:24,772 --> 00:25:25,623
Luke's.

601
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,784
Hey, dad.

602
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,584
April, hey. What's going on?

603
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:30,223
Not much. How are you?

604
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:31,805
Good. Doing the lunch thing.

605
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:33,205
I tried you on your home phone first. 

606
00:25:33,206 --> 00:25:34,471
I don't know what I was thinking.

607
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:36,604
Well another 10 minutes,
 and I'd have been up there. 

608
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:38,382
So, what's going on? Just call to say hi?

609
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:40,375
Actually, I've got some news. 

610
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:41,966
Good news, I hope.

611
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,237
Good and bad, actually.

612
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:45,389
Tell me.

613
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,855
Well, in January, 

614
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:50,929
I filled out this application 
for the Metropolitan museum science camp. 

615
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,083
I wasn't even gonna do it, but Mr. Lazovic, 

616
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,015
my chemistry teacher -- 

617
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:56,868
he wrote me this really 
nice recommendation. Anyway, 

618
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:57,972
I totally forgot about it,

619
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,868
 'cause I didn't think I'd ever get in, but I did.

620
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:05,587
Wow, April. Congratulations. That's terrific.

621
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:09,366
Yeah, it is. The only problem is it's six weeks, 

622
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:12,371
- and it's right during our boat trip.
- Oh.

623
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,610
Yeah and I've been so torn because

624
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:16,412
 I really want to take this trip with you, 

625
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:19,437
but this camp is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

626
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:20,874
They only take eighth-graders,

627
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,215
 so this would be the only year I could go,

628
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,936
 and they would have
 kids from all over the world there, 

629
00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:28,088
and they'd have Nobel-winning 
scientists come and teach classes and stuff.

630
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,579
Yeah well, that sounds, uh, pretty incredible.

631
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,848
Yeah, but I really want to take this trip with you.

632
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,756
Yeah, look, it's too good an
 opportunity for you to pass up.

633
00:26:40,757 --> 00:26:41,616
You think?

634
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:44,757
I do. I mean the boat's not 
going anywhere. We'll do it next summer.

635
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,211
- Okay. Are you sure?
- Absolutely. 

636
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,262
Okay and It's only six weeks, 

637
00:26:50,263 --> 00:26:51,391
so I could definitely spend 

638
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:52,560
the last two weeks of the summer with you.

639
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:54,861
Well then that's great. 
We'll take a little trip somewhere.

640
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:56,017
Yeah, definitely.

641
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:58,244
I am so proud of you, kid.

642
00:26:58,845 --> 00:27:01,353
Thanks, dad. Um, I'm gonna
 tell mom that we talked, okay?

643
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:02,702
Okay. I'll call you later.

644
00:27:03,003 --> 00:27:04,280
- Love you.
- Love you, too. 

645
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:28,426
Very nice!

646
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:34,366
You're a terrific crowd!

647
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:38,562
Yeah we have one more song, 
and then karaoke night will begin.

648
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,617
I dedicate this next song to my husband, Morey.

649
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,676
Hey, do you know what would 
really put me over the top spirit-wise?

650
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:16,256
What?

651
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:17,364
If you sang.

652
00:28:17,365 --> 00:28:22,055
Oh, yeah! On the way home, 
we'll roll down the windows. I'll belt it out.

653
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:23,180
No. Up there.

654
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,533
Oh, no. I'd have to be way more drunk for that.

655
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:29,542
Well, we can arrange that. 
Excuse me. Could we get some shots here?

656
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,935
I've never even been to 
half the cities we're going to.

657
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:37,656
 I mean, Detroit -- how psyched am I?

658
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:38,576
You seem really psyched.

659
00:28:38,577 --> 00:28:42,464
I'm totally psyched. Detroit is
 a major music hub, man, for everybody.

660
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:44,997
 It's not just about Eminem 
and Iggy pop and Motown.

661
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:45,784
Oh no.

662
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:48,277
And we're not just playing 
anywhere. We're playing The Magic Stick. 

663
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:50,855
Everybody's played The
 Magic Stick -- crooked fingers, 

664
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:53,025
The Rose Buds, Bobby Conn, Midlay.

665
00:28:53,026 --> 00:28:54,289
- Wow.
- It's gonna be nuts.

666
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,141
I'm really happy for you, Zach.

667
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:58,649
And it just works out so perfect time wise.

668
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,176
 I mean obviously, I'm gonna 
have to miss a couple weeks' work, 

669
00:29:01,177 --> 00:29:03,348
but, for the most part, you'll be
 closed for the summer, anyway, so�

670
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:06,362
Actually, that's not happening now.

671
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:06,860
What?

672
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:08,396
Yeah April and I aren't going away,

673
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:09,800
 I mean at least not for most of the summer

674
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:11,302
, so I'm gonna keep the diner open.

675
00:29:11,303 --> 00:29:13,387
Oh, man, that totally blows. What happened?

676
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:16,377
Oh she's going to this camp -- this science camp. 

677
00:29:16,378 --> 00:29:17,851
You know she's super smart -- I mean like,

678
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:20,652
 off-the-charts smart -- and she got invited, 

679
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:24,010
and it's real prestigious. 
And she's got to go. She can't not go.

680
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:25,389
Buddy, I'm so sorry.

681
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,292
Oh, it's okay.

682
00:29:26,293 --> 00:29:29,210
- No I know how stoked you were for this trip.
- No it's all right Zach�

683
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:31,601
- All that planning -- you were really into it.
- It's okay Zach.

684
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:33,201
- No! It's not. It sucks.
- Zach.

685
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:36,141
Okay, I'm sorry. I get it. You're processing.

686
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,689
- Hey! Hey, babe.
- Hey. 

687
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,019
- Hey, Luke!
- Lane, hey! It's been a little while.

688
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,717
Yeah I know I can't believe 

689
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:47,621
I'm actually out of the 
apartment at night and baby-free.

690
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:49,889
 I feel like I'm missing a limb -- or two, actually.

691
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,646
You look good.

692
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,267
Thanks. I'm exhausted. 

693
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:53,911
But psyched to be out on the town, right?

694
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:56,586
So psyched. So are you coming to K.C.'s?

695
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:57,666
Ah I don't think so.

696
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:01,096
Dude, you've got to come. 
He just got some totally devastating news.

697
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:02,737
It's actually not that bad.

698
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:03,733
He's still processing.

699
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,734
Luke, you should come

700
00:30:04,735 --> 00:30:06,555
Come on let me buy you a beer

701
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,551
You know you guys, go ahead. Maybe I'll catch up.

702
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:09,571
Okay. That's cool.

703
00:30:09,572 --> 00:30:11,535
- So, maybe we'll see you there.
- Sure.

704
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,090
So, what was the news?

705
00:30:20,091 --> 00:30:22,926
- Oh. April bailed on the boat trip.
- Oh, no.

706
00:30:22,927 --> 00:30:26,168
Yeah she's going away to some 
brainiac science camp for the summer. 

707
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:28,019
Who's even heard of science camp? 

708
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,054
It's a contradiction in terms. It's like a�

709
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:37,561
-Oxymoron.
- Oxymoron -- totally. Are you okay there, babe?

710
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,630
Yeah, I just kind of realized something today.

711
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:41,631
Yeah what's that?

712
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,351
I realized I can't go on tour. 
I'd love to -- god, I'd love to -- 

713
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:48,833
but it's just not possible -- not with two babies. 

714
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:52,365
I mean, you know it's hard enough here at home, 

715
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:53,664
where I have a whole support system -- 

716
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:56,483
my mom and Brian and 
Dr. Shaw. I've got my routine,

717
00:30:56,484 --> 00:30:58,607
 and it's hard, but it's manageable. 

718
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,000
But it wouldn't be anywhere but here, you know?

719
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,606
- No, I get it. I do.
- I'm so sorry, Zach.

720
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,050
You don't have to be sorry 
about anything. It makes sense. 

721
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:08,962
It's cool. I'll call graham in the morning

722
00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:10,948
 and tell him we can't go. He'll understand.

723
00:31:10,949 --> 00:31:12,953
No. Wait. That's not what I'm saying. 

724
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,018
I'm saying I can't go. I still want you to go.

725
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,896
- You do?
- Hell, yeah.

726
00:31:17,097 --> 00:31:18,993
No way. Not without you and the boys.

727
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:22,079
Zach, this is a really big opportunity.

728
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,956
Yeah, but it's two months.

729
00:31:23,957 --> 00:31:26,887
Exactly. It's not a yearlong world tour.

730
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:30,295
 It's two months, it's 
important, it's a dream come true, 

731
00:31:30,296 --> 00:31:31,765
and who knows where it could lead?

732
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,303
Are you sure?

733
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,147
I am. We'll talk all the time, 

734
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:39,423
and I'll hold the phone up to Steve and Kwan's ears 

735
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:40,353
so they can hear your voice. 

736
00:31:40,354 --> 00:31:43,819
I'll see your shows in
 New York and Philly and Boston. 

737
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,243
We'll work this out.

738
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:49,680
You are the coolest.

739
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:53,509
Well, I am married to the lead guitarist of vapor rub.

740
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:20,948
How you feeling there, mom?

741
00:32:20,949 --> 00:32:23,614
Ah I must be drunk, 'cause he sounds pretty good.

742
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,961
Well, get those pipes 
warmed up, 'cause you're on deck.

743
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:29,074
I can't follow Kirk. He can really sing!

744
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,611
Come on, mom. If you don't, 

745
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:41,000
then you're gonna ruin all this
 good cheering up you've been doing.

746
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,543
You are relentless!

747
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,702
I'm thinking something early Madonna.

748
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,202
- Hey!
- Oh, Lane!

749
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:48,577
What are you doing here?

750
00:32:48,578 --> 00:32:49,484
I'm just catching up with my mom.

751
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:51,904
Hi, Lane. Hey what's up, Zach?

752
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,185
Not much, Lorelai. How are you?

753
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:54,842
Good. A little tipsy.

754
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:56,476
Seems like an appropriate setting for that. 

755
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:58,729
Okay, this is just sinful.

756
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,317
Be nice.

757
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:01,051
I'm just saying If you're gonna do Boy George, 

758
00:33:01,052 --> 00:33:02,793
at least commit to the high heels and the makeup.

759
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:04,162
Hey, sit. Sit.

760
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:09,841
- Okay. So, are you done with finals already? 
-Ah�

761
00:33:09,842 --> 00:33:11,126
Wait. Are you actually done with school?

762
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:13,819
- Um not yet, very soon. I'll be done next week.
- Oh.

763
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:15,901
Pretzels or peanuts?

764
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:18,266
Oh, peanuts, and remember 
-- if you slip out the back door,

765
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:19,503
 I will sink into a deep depression.

766
00:33:19,504 --> 00:33:20,386
Drat!

767
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:23,857
So, how are the boys?

768
00:33:23,858 --> 00:33:28,102
Awesome, exhausting, amazing,
 infuriating. You name it, I feel it. 

769
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:30,617
I'm gonna get a beer. Ginger ale for you, mom?

770
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:31,644
- Sure.
- Rory?

771
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:32,128
I'm good.

772
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:32,960
Be right back.

773
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,853
So, really, what's going on with you?

774
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:40,531
Oh, I just had a bit of a meltdown, that's all.

775
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:41,586
Why? What's going on?

776
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:44,323
There's this job that 
I really wanted, and I didn't get it. 

777
00:33:44,324 --> 00:33:47,078
I was pretty bummed about 
it, but my mom talked me down, 

778
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:49,877
and everything's fine now.
 What's going on with you?

779
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:53,034
Well, Zach is going on a 2-month tour this summer 

780
00:33:53,035 --> 00:33:56,344
as the lead guitarist of 
Vapor Rub, and, yes, I'm serious.

781
00:33:56,345 --> 00:33:58,454
Vapor Rub? Whatever happened to Hep Alien?

782
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:01,028
Well, Hep Alien will live to rock again, 

783
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:02,696
but right now, opportunity calls.

784
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,074
Isn't it gonna be hard for you guys to be apart?

785
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:07,567
Definitely, but, you know, it's only two months

786
00:34:07,568 --> 00:34:09,707
. And we'll make it work. Life is long.

787
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,405
When did you get so mature?

788
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:14,814
I think the mature gene kicks
 in once you become a mother.

789
00:34:39,096 --> 00:34:41,813
Honey, it's another 
embarrassing moment for your diary. 

790
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:47,250
 Uh-oh. 
 Happy graduation.

791
00:34:50,550 --> 00:35:01,928
If I... should stay 
I would only be in your way�

792
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,663
She's a Whitney fan?

793
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:05,623
Oh, I think it's Dolly-inspired.

794
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:15,091
But I know I'll think of you
 each step of the way,

795
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:22,415
- and I-I-I will always love you�
- She's all right!

796
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,272
The kid's stealing our thunder!

797
00:35:24,273 --> 00:35:30,883
I will always love you. 

798
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,632
Bittersweet memories, 

799
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:54,262
that's all I'm taking with me, 
so goodbye please don't c-cry,

800
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:10,427
We both know I'm not what you need,
and I will always love you,


801
00:36:11,655 --> 00:36:25,514
I will always love you.
I hope life treats you kind, 


802
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:37,683
and I hope you have all you dreamed of, 
and I wish you joy and happiness,

803
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:55,911
but above all I wish you love,
and I-I-I will always love you,

804
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:11,772
I will always love you,
I will always... love you 

805
00:37:34,908 --> 00:37:37,083
- Morning.
- Coffee?

806
00:37:37,084 --> 00:37:40,168
Yeah. What are you doing up?
 Why aren't you more hung over?

807
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:42,969
Well, I stopped drinking several shots before you did.

808
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:43,852
Are you going?

809
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,067
Yeah. I'm gonna stop by Lane's. 

810
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:47,807
Then I have to get back to school and 

811
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,086
start studying for my next final.

812
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:51,222
 This time, I intend on turning in all my blue books.

813
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:54,013
That's too bad. I had a whole 
second day of pick-me-up plans,

814
00:37:54,014 --> 00:37:56,424
 including a clown and some pony rides 

815
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:58,199
and absolutely no drinking at all.

816
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,500
Well then you shouldn't have devised such an 

817
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:01,088
effective first-day pick-me-up plan.

818
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:02,613
Well, live and learn.

819
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,176
I really do feel better, though -- 

820
00:38:04,177 --> 00:38:06,170
all the wallowing and the eating and the shopping. 

821
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:09,488
And I don't know maybe it's 
because you wished me joy and happiness.

822
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:11,493
You liked that, huh?

823
00:38:11,494 --> 00:38:12,457
It cheered me up.

824
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,343
Well, glad it did.

825
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,315
I do feel so much better, though. 

826
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:18,127
It's like you said -- sometimes 

827
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:19,409
you just have to let your feelings out.

828
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,134
Yeah. Sometimes you do. 

829
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:27,055
- Chilaquiles, huh?
- Chilaquiles.

830
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,330
People went nuts for them. 

831
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:30,558
Mr. And Mrs. Fiss said they 
want them every morning now. 

832
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:32,620
Who knew? I didn't even think we'd sell one of them.

833
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:34,713
Well it was all Caesar -- his idea, his recipe, 

834
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:36,417
his refusal to take no for an answer.

835
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:38,284
Hey, Caesar. Chilaquiles!

836
00:38:38,285 --> 00:38:41,284
- Chilaquiles! What'd I tell you, Luke?
- You told me, Caesar. 

837
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:41,928
I told you.

838
00:38:41,929 --> 00:38:43,243
You also told me you told me.

839
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:44,043
Chilaquiles!

840
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,948
That dude's a riot. 

841
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,253
Hey I'm glad you came out last night.

842
00:38:48,254 --> 00:38:49,274
Yeah, it was fun.

843
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:50,696
Gypsy does a mean Pat Benatar.

844
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:51,891
That was interesting.

845
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:53,183
- How about Lorelai?
- Huh?

846
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,516
- What did you think?
- Oh, uh...

847
00:38:55,517 --> 00:38:57,421
I mean the gal can sing, right? 

848
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,698
Bizarro choice of tune, but she's got some pipes. 

849
00:38:59,699 --> 00:39:00,546
Nice quality, you know?

850
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,211
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely.

851
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,250
So you feeling better? 

852
00:39:04,251 --> 00:39:06,158
Nah you still bumming 
about your boat trip, aren't you? 

853
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:07,506
Of course you are. Why am I asking?

854
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:10,704
No, no, no, it's okay. 
I'm actually feeling a little better.

855
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:13,187
 And you know hanging around 
here this summer might not be so bad.

856
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:14,159
That's cool. 

857
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,276
Maybe we can make karaoke 
night at K.C.'s kind of a regular thing.

858
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:18,229
Yeah, maybe.

859
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,355
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

860
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,458
 In the middle of breakfast rush, I found your hat. 

861
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:22,861
It was wedged in behind the dishwasher. 

862
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,416
- No worse for the wear, though.
- Yeah thanks.

863
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,782
Yeah I told you it'd turn up.

864
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:51,969
- Just a minute! Oh, hey.
- Hey.

865
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,499
Oh, you just missed Rory. 
She's on her way back to school.

866
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,858
I know, I'm actually here to see you.

867
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:57,780
Oh. Okay. Come on in.

868
00:39:57,781 --> 00:39:58,661
Thank you.

869
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,507
Do you want, um, any food or 
drink? I ordered way too many fries.

870
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:05,796
No, thanks. I'm all good.

871
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:13,480
Here, have a seat. 
Paul Anka! Um... so, how was your trip?

872
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,327
Oh, it was really great. 

873
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,605
Actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

874
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:17,418
Oh, god. I know nothing about that world.

875
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:20,049
 Apple, IBM, Microsoft�I'm out.

876
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,148
Well, I've been offered a position
 with an emerging internet company.

877
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,761
Wow, that's great.

878
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:27,643
Yeah it's pretty similar
 to what I was doing in New York, 

879
00:40:27,644 --> 00:40:29,762
but actually they're willing 
to make me a full partner. 

880
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:31,112
I'll be getting in on the ground floor.

881
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,851
That's exciting!

882
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:34,557
It is. It's gonna be a lot of long hours and 

883
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,363
an incredible amount of work building the company,

884
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:38,808
 but I really feel this venture has a bright future.

885
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:40,689
 I mean, these are serious people.

886
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,831
And you're a serious guy. 
Look, you don't have to convince me. 

887
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:47,864
I voiced my concerns, and you told me your plans. 

888
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,343
We had pie. I'm cool.

889
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:51,961
Thank you. I appreciate
 that. That means a lot to me.

890
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,730
Oh. You're welcome.

891
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,858
So, the thing is -- as you can imagine, 

892
00:40:58,859 --> 00:40:59,835
I'm pretty excited about all this.

893
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:00,974
Y-yeah.

894
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:05,664
But it does mean a move to
 San Francisco -- Palo Alto, actually.

895
00:41:05,665 --> 00:41:07,842
- Oh, wow. 
- Yeah.

896
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:10,314
That's big. That's funny that Rory didn't mention it.

897
00:41:10,315 --> 00:41:11,630
Well actually, I haven't told her yet.

898
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:15,315
And you're here 'cause
 you want me to tell her for you?

899
00:41:15,316 --> 00:41:17,078
No, no. I'm gonna tell her. 

900
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,132
I just um, I wanted to talk to you first about it.

901
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,262
 Okay. That's...thoughtful.

902
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:32,421
Look... I love Rory. She means the world to me, 

903
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:37,107
- and I want her to come with me to California.
- Oh.

904
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,819
But not just as my 
girlfriend, which is why I'm here.

905
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,165
 I'm here to ask your permission -- 

906
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,654
your permission to ask Rory to marry me.

907
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,655
Lorelai? Lorelai?
