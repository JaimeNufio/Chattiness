1
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,031
Get away from me, Christopher.

2
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,606
- I just want to talk.
- Get some coffee, Christopher!

3
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:02,608
This wasn’t the way I wanted it to go down.

4
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,399
I wanted to get you alone and – what are you doing?

5
00:01:04,461 --> 00:01:05,758
I’m going after Luke!

6
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,195
Oh, there you are!

7
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,794
I’ve got her!

8
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,486
Oh, you cannot keep a room full of Anglo-Saxons waiting for cake this long!

9
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,215
They start to form more clubs.

10
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:19,693
Take her, take her, take her!

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,300
All right, wonderful. There we are.

12
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,040
Okay. Everyone, in just a little closer.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,700
That’s perfect, hold that.

14
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:31,936
You and me, we’re done.

15
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:33,800
One, two, three.

16
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:38,163
Are you leaving?

17
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:39,801
Party's over. It is so over.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,932
Are you okay?

19
00:01:41,036 --> 00:01:42,806
Yeah. I'm fine. It's just time to go.

20
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:46,211
Are we okay? I mean, that wasn't exactly my proudest moment.

21
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:48,622
Aw, honey. You're the daughter of a woman

22
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:51,740
who has had no end of less than proud moments. Don't worry.

23
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:53,174
Luke was so mad.

24
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:55,980
That's because to Luke you're still ten years old wearing feathered angel's wings

25
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,591
going door-to-door inviting people to a caterpillar's funeral.

26
00:01:58,652 --> 00:01:59,835
Oh, now, I did that once.

27
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:01,361
- Luke is fine.
- I hope so.

28
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:06,005
Look, go back in. Catch up with Logan. Tell him everything is fine.

29
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:07,699
He went right to his car, he split.

30
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:09,020
I don't blame the boy.

31
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:10,311
And what's with you and Grandma?

32
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,830
- All these questions!
- Sorry.

33
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,229
Look. Go back in, huh? Make the best of things.

34
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:19,829
Luke is just, um, bringing the car around. I'll talk to you later.

35
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:20,971
Are you sure we're good?

36
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:22,025
Always.

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,331
'Kay. Bye, Mom.

38
00:02:23,684 --> 00:02:24,605
Bye, mister.

39
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:29,409
Oh, excuse me. I'm going to need a cab, please?

40
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:30,059
Yes, ma'am.

41
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,977
There you are. I'd love to get a few more shots in.

42
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,718
Yeah, so would I.

43
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:53,915
Hi.

44
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,415
I was just on my break.

45
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,926
Oh, that's no problem. Caesar, listen -

46
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:59,169
I clocked out too, so it should say so on my time card.

47
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,649
Right.

48
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,815
Although the ink is kinda weak and faded. It's really hard to see.

49
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:04,027
That's fine. Great.

50
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:05,666
Caesar, is Luke back yet?

51
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,062
Didn't you guys go somewhere tonight?

52
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:07,586
Yeah.

53
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:08,855
Did you get separated or something?

54
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:10,654
Something like that. So have you seen him?

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,964
Not unless I fell asleep.

56
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,899
And I never fall asleep.

57
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:16,449
Well, so if you didn't fall asleep you know for a fact he's not back.

58
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,304
Right.

59
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,398
So you didn't come back together, huh?

60
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,262
Long story. Getting kinda late, so -

61
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,147
If I see him, should I tell him to call you?

62
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:24,005
Yes, please.

63
00:04:24,094 --> 00:04:28,471
Okay. And, if you talk to him, could you maybe not mention the radio, or eating the pie?

64
00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:30,191
He hates when I eat out of the pie plate.

65
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,501
You were eating out of the pie plate?

66
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:32,812
No. No.

67
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,481
Well, thanks, Caesar. See ya.

68
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:37,180
I've got lots of work to do, and I'm hankering to get to it.

69
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:38,455
Okay. Bye.

70
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,517
Lorelai! Hey!

71
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,260
Hi! Babette! Hey, Morey.

72
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:43,022
Hey, Lorelai.

73
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:45,734
Look at you all dolled up and walking the street.

74
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:47,554
I'm not calling you a hooker or nothing.

75
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,720
Well, thank you.

76
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:53,046
Hey, um, did you guys pass Luke, or see his truck any time tonight?

77
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:55,739
- You're not with Luke?
- Not at the moment.

78
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:57,215
What?

79
00:04:57,301 --> 00:04:59,124
Didn't you go to your parents' wedding thing tonight?

80
00:04:59,185 --> 00:04:59,738
Yes.

81
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:01,018
What?

82
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,182
You didn't come back together?

83
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,413
Well, of course we did. We're just not together at the moment.

84
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:06,590
Would you guys stop doing that?

85
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,556
Everything's all right between the two of you, isn't it?

86
00:05:08,657 --> 00:05:10,235
- Of course it is.
- I hope so.

87
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,099
Otherwise Taylor would go crazy.

88
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:15,359
He's got all these contingency plans, remember, in case you guys split?

89
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:17,351
He's worried what it would do to the town.

90
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:18,555
Big anal creep.

91
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:20,792
Well, there's no splitting happening here. Everything's fine.

92
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:21,571
Good.

93
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:23,736
Well, we'd better be going. Take care, doll.

94
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,349
Talk to you guys later. Bye.

95
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:40,382
Luke, it's, uh, me. Again.

96
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,344
Well, another very exciting night comes to a close, huh?

97
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:48,579
Um, I don't think you're home, so I'm going home.

98
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:51,114
Um, I'll leave my cell phone on, or call me at home.

99
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,530
Anytime you want. 'Kay. Bye.

100
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:56,448
Just please, call me, okay? 'Bye.

101
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:15,566
Paris!

102
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,220
Paris.

103
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,309
Paris!

104
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,197
Are you asleep?

105
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:26,559
Don't turn the light on.

106
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:29,115
Aah! I said don't turn the light on!

107
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,200
I didn't hear the ‘don't’.

108
00:06:30,304 --> 00:06:32,606
Why do you think I would tell you to turn on the light when I'm dead asleep?

109
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,824
I didn't know you were dead asleep.

110
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:34,757
The room is dark.

111
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,988
I'm under the covers and completely immobile.

112
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:37,946
Deduce, Sherlock.

113
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:39,677
Well, you're awake now. Can I ask you a question?

114
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:40,444
Bite me.

115
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:41,931
Were there any messages for me?

116
00:06:42,062 --> 00:06:42,821
Yes.

117
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,981
Four other people called and asked that you bite me.

118
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,818
Look, I'm serious here. Come on, Paris.

119
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:51,044
It is especially important tonight that, if there was a message for me,

120
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,323
that that message gets to me.

121
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:55,206
If there was a message, I would have left it on the message board.

122
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:58,800
The board is blank. And you are not the most reliable message leaver.

123
00:06:58,872 --> 00:06:59,952
No messages.

124
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:03,951
Okay. I don't mean to insult you, but are you maybe telling me there's no message

125
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,450
because you're mad that I woke you and there really was a message?

126
00:07:06,522 --> 00:07:08,273
Oh, my God, you're annoying tonight!

127
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:10,397
What's with being all k. d.lang?

128
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,320
It was for my grandparents' vow renewal. I was the best man.

129
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:14,533
Is that kinky or something?

130
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:15,569
It was a cute thing.

131
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:16,890
So, who's the boy?

132
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:17,576
What boy?

133
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:19,342
The boy you're dying to get a message from.

134
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:20,627
I assume it's a boy.

135
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:21,666
Not necessarily.

136
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,912
Well, no one called, left a note, smoke signaled,

137
00:07:25,031 --> 00:07:27,349
Morse coded, semaphore flagged or came by.

138
00:07:27,436 --> 00:07:29,148
Male, female or hermaphrodite.

139
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:30,484
Okay, thanks.

140
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:32,880
I'm wide awake. It's your fault.

141
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:34,738
- You owe me Boggle.
- Paris -

142
00:07:34,907 --> 00:07:35,567
Boggle!

143
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,144
One game and then it's back to bed!

144
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,210
Hey, Lorelai.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,510
Kirk, you're dripping wet.

146
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,260
Sweat is the curse of the b-boy. Mos Def.

147
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,914
So, are you feeling better?

148
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:04,870
Yeah. I'm feeling fine, why?

149
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:06,417
Luke told me you weren't feeling well.

150
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,691
Luke? You've seen Luke?

151
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:09,862
He came into the movie theater. I'm on my break,

152
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:12,673
so I figured I'd come down and bust a sweet move.

153
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:13,574
When, when?

154
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,766
Oh, about a half hour ago.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,116
I asked about you and he said you weren't feeling well.

156
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:22,866
Then he rejected my 'buy two Junior Mints, get a free hunk of onion beef jerky' offer

157
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:25,319
with a disgusting profanity, then took a seat.

158
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,047
So, he's there now?

159
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:28,304
Probably. Nothing's up with you two, is there?

160
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:29,809
I mean, you seem just fine.

161
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:31,452
No, nothing. Nothing's wrong at all.

162
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,737
Kirk, we have not broken up.

163
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:36,087
Well, why are you guys dressed up but not together?

164
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:40,607
Luke's in a suit, which seems awfully formal for a movie theater that recycles its popcorn -

165
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:44,263
Oh, well, we had a fancy event to go to, um, then I got the sniffles,

166
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:47,704
and so Luke decided to see a movie, but now I'm feeling better, so I came looking for him.

167
00:08:47,802 --> 00:08:51,027
I hope that's true, 'cause Taylor would go nuts if you two broke up.

168
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,274
Well, that is not the case, so there's nothing to worry about.

169
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:54,329
Do you think he's still there?

170
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:55,906
The movie just started when I left.

171
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,600
Great. Thanks a lot, Kirk.

172
00:08:57,729 --> 00:08:58,764
So I can go in without paying?

173
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,840
- No!
- Thank you.

174
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:01,691
My towel!

175
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:23,559
What are you watching?

176
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:25,659
Something stupid.

177
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:35,550
Man. They sure talked fast in these things.

178
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:38,649
Yep, they, uh, they did.

179
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:39,729
Fast.

180
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,455
I have been frantically trying to call your cell phone.

181
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,606
I turned it off.

182
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:48,131
That's what I figured.

183
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:54,296
So do you want to hear my explanations, 'cause I've got 'em.

184
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:58,397
Explanations, perspective, apologies, I've got 'em all,

185
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,968
and I'm dying to share them with you.

186
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,321
I just need some time.

187
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,215
Time -

188
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:05,079
A little time, to think.

189
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:07,997
And to process.

190
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:09,671
Right.

191
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:13,619
I get that. I get that.

192
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:18,232
I just have so much I want to say to you.

193
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:19,548
Not right now.

194
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:21,989
I need to clear my head.

195
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:30,786
Okay. You'll call me when you're ready?

196
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:33,499
- Yeah.
- Okay. Good.

197
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:34,621
Okay.

198
00:10:38,118 --> 00:10:39,664
So, I should -

199
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:01,763
Figure as your little girls arrive, we'll have them here in the living room.

200
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,071
We'll have the pocket doors to the dining room closed.

201
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:08,408
Then, when it's time for breakfast, we'll open the doors, and voila, the full, beautiful effect.

202
00:11:08,474 --> 00:11:09,074
Wonderful.

203
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,506
We'll have music with a nice little fanfare. You like Yanni?

204
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:13,282
Hate him with every fiber of my being.

205
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:14,706
Oh, good, we're in perfect sync.

206
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:19,831
And then, we'll have small-scale tables set with china, a silver tea service,

207
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,847
little plates, little cups, and twelve little chairs for all of them to sit on.

208
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,213
- That's so cute.
- Yeah.

209
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,907
Wait, twelve? I thought there were six. Six little girls.

210
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,580
Six girls and their six dolls.

211
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:29,534
I beg your pardon?

212
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,724
This is a pancake breakfast for the girls and their dolls.

213
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:33,378
Get out of town.

214
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,269
I thought you knew that.

215
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,743
Dolls, as in they don't have stomachs, lungs or spleens?

216
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:38,391
And we are serving them breakfast?

217
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:38,969
That's right.

218
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,453
Teeth? Throat? Colons? They don't have these things either?

219
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,815
Unless they are Brides of Chucky.

220
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,243
I'm not paying attention to you anymore.

221
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:47,838
All right, well, I'll order everything, and all you have to do is show up.

222
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,536
The girls are looking forward to this. So are the dolls!

223
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:51,631
Aw, love that.

224
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:52,968
- 'Bye.
- Okay, bye.

225
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,086
Is she psychotic?

226
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:02,373
It’s silly fun, Michel, girls love dolls. Chill.

227
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:06,469
I'm making little pancakes for the dolls, and I found these little forks they can use.

228
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:08,579
They do not have opposable thumbs!

229
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,339
Who, the girls? Oh, this is a handicapped group! Poor things.

230
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:12,844
No, the dolls.

231
00:12:12,956 --> 00:12:14,441
The dolls? How can a doll be handicapped?

232
00:12:14,523 --> 00:12:17,139
My point exactly! They are plastic and made in Banglagor!

233
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,367
We're doing this. So hop on board, or hop off.

234
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:21,952
Okay! You don't need to snap my nose off!

235
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,068
He's getting on your nerves, huh?

236
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:24,876
Completely.

237
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:26,381
I'm starving.

238
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:28,004
Didn't you have anything at Luke's today?

239
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:29,465
Not today.

240
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:31,373
There's no food in this fridge.

241
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:32,704
It's stuffed with food.

242
00:12:32,777 --> 00:12:36,749
Food that's edible. Food to consume. Everything in here you have to cook.

243
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,654
- I'm a cook.
- Oh, forget it.

244
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:39,960
What's wrong?

245
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,453
Nothing. Luke and I had a little disagreement last night.

246
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:44,670
At the wedding? What happened?

247
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:46,709
- Christopher showed up.
- Oh, no.

248
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,885
- My mother invited him.
- Oh, no!

249
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:53,312
And I hadn't exactly told Luke about that tequila night with Chris after his dad died,

250
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:56,841
so I told him and there was a big blow-up. Chris went nuts, Luke went nuts,

251
00:12:56,918 --> 00:13:01,138
and he got mad, and he left. And now he says he needs time to think.

252
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:01,966
How much time?

253
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:03,184
He just said, 'Time'.

254
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,432
Ooh, I hate when men do that. It's so vague.

255
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:09,230
I should have told him when it happened. But I blew it.

256
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:13,445
Now, if he'd just give me ten minutes we could hash it out and be back on our way,

257
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:15,851
and not waste time. What's enough time?

258
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:16,707
I don't know.

259
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:18,581
It's been twelve hours. That enough?

260
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:19,373
I'd say no.

261
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:21,397
I'll be distracted until we fix this.

262
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:25,073
Well, don't worry, because when a relationship is right, things work out.

263
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:26,260
I hope so.

264
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:29,205
I heard about this couple on one of those morning show,

265
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:34,218
similar to you guys - all lovey-dovey, perfect for each other, you know, headed for marriage -

266
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:37,950
and something happened, and they broke up in their senior year of college,

267
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:40,055
even though they were madly in love with each other.

268
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:44,719
They moved to different parts of the country. They married different people.

269
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,433
They married different people?

270
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:51,282
Oh, had kids, grandkids. Then their spouses died, oh, and they were available again,

271
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,481
and they talked and they hooked up, and now they're together

272
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:59,547
and they're happily in love after forty years apart. Uh!

273
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:02,415
That's a horrible story!

274
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:03,106
No, it's not!

275
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:05,006
What morning show was that on? I hate that story!

276
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:06,321
But they ended up together!

277
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,639
Was it Katie Couric? She seems very dark to me.

278
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:11,324
The point is that even if it takes forty years to figure it out,

279
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:13,309
there's still a chance for a happy ending!

280
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:16,597
But that's all they had! An ending! I don't want to have just an ending with Luke!

281
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:17,380
I know, but -

282
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,330
I don't want to have those stupid kids or those ugly grandkids with that loser other guy!

283
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,449
You don't know, he could be a nice guy.

284
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,604
Even if he's a nice, guy, he's not the guy I want to be with!

285
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:26,068
You're right. It's not fair to him.

286
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,610
It's not fair to him, it's dishonest.

287
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:30,011
We should name the other guy. I feel like he'd be a Larry.

288
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:31,229
We're not naming the other guy.

289
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:33,190
Okay. I guess it was a bad example.

290
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:35,162
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

291
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:41,060
But you know, I read a story about another guy that had a fight with his girlfriend,

292
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,598
and he said he needed like a week to think it over, and he only needed a day.

293
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,409
And he and the girl were back together and were happy forever.

294
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:50,625
No Larry, or loser kids, or anything.

295
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:54,880
They don't put stuff like that in the newspapers, 'cause it's not as sexy as the forty year story,

296
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,713
but it happens all the time, really.

297
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:58,387
- Thanks for making that up.
- You're welcome.

298
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:01,786
I'm going to go take a walk. I've got some errands to run.

299
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:03,625
Good. Clear your head.

300
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:05,693
- And it was Katie Couric.
- I knew it.

301
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,943
Don't forget the raisin bran. It's good for you. Keeps you moving.

302
00:15:13,148 --> 00:15:14,278
Whatever that means.

303
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,285
Ew, I just got what that means!

304
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:19,871
Cognitive skills are slow today. Grab some Corn Flakes.

305
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:22,257
Nietzsche and Lichtenstein went ape guano over Corn Flakes.

306
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,304
They make you smart, German and depressed.

307
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:26,967
Why do they have so much Wheat Chex? It doesn't go with anything.

308
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:29,408
Wheat Chex are sort of the pumpernickel bread of the cereal world.

309
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,064
Well put.

310
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:32,220
So what combo are you thinking today?

311
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,291
Cap'n Crunch over a foundation of Rice Krispies, with a perimeter of Shredded Wheat.

312
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,811
- Bold.
- I like its prospects.

313
00:15:37,878 --> 00:15:39,578
- I love cereal.
- It rocks.

314
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:44,370
So, you never told me who the guy was.

315
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:45,357
Guy?

316
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:47,108
The guy you were dying for a message from?

317
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,819
The guy who has you yoked to your cell phone?

318
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,117
I am not yoked to my cell phone. I can't hear it when it's in my pocket.

319
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:54,677
Oh, God! Tell me it's not Huntzberger.

320
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:55,618
What if it is?

321
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:57,835
With the hair, and the chin like he's the fourth Bee Gee?

322
00:15:57,907 --> 00:15:59,884
You know, I could put the phone away if it's bothering you.

323
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:03,564
Don't. That pathetic boat you're in? I'm first oarsman.

324
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:05,633
- How so?
- I'm waiting for Doyle to call.

325
00:16:05,787 --> 00:16:09,274
I expected a call yesterday to set something up for last night, but it never came.

326
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:13,591
So I ate a family-sized bag of salt and vinegar potato chips and went to bed at seven-thirty.

327
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:14,609
That was the smell.

328
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:16,375
We're better than this, you and me.

329
00:16:16,472 --> 00:16:18,900
We're the children of Emma Goldman and Hillary Clinton.

330
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:21,731
Strong, independent. We're better than this.

331
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:22,530
Apparently not.

332
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,756
I blame Chilton. Great education, but horrific socialization.

333
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,459
- We need guidance.
- I'm not calling Love Line.

334
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:31,387
Rory, come on. We're sitting in a sea of expertise in this field.

335
00:16:31,485 --> 00:16:34,000
The college campus. There's no end of knock-headed bimbos

336
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,322
with tons of dross to dispense. There's two now.

337
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:37,900
Paris, don't.

338
00:16:37,982 --> 00:16:39,621
Althea! Janet! Come here!

339
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,305
You hate Althea and Janet.

340
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:44,274
Granted, they know nothing of Ukrainian politics or the periodic table,

341
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,312
but when it comes to boys, they're brighter than the Brontes.

342
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,136
What, Paris?

343
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:48,544
Hey, Janet. Althea.

344
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,105
Girls, we have related problems. A little love trouble.

345
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:52,298
- We?
- Bend your ears?

346
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,920
- Uh, sure.
- No, Althea, please.

347
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:57,157
Go. Enjoy your Sunday. There's no love trouble here.

348
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,755
- I don't mind.
- I do.

349
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,545
Fine, then I'll just lay out my situation.

350
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,139
Great. Good. 'Cause I'm out of this.

351
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:04,161
- Okay, so I've got a guy.
- Blind?

352
00:17:04,228 --> 00:17:07,607
Can it. Last time I saw him, he strongly implied that he was going to call me.

353
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:09,532
And soon. It's been four days.

354
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:10,653
You ever call him to hook up?

355
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:11,703
He's always taken the reins.

356
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:12,778
What did he say exactly?

357
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:14,185
Call you later, or see you later?

358
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,092
Call. Or was it see?

359
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:16,869
Very different.

360
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,709
Call's more descriptive. If he said 'call you later' and he didn't, it's an egregious 'screw you'.

361
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:21,712
I'm pretty sure it was see.

362
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:23,146
Then I think you could cut him some slack.

363
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,492
- You like him, right?
- Yeah.

364
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:25,982
Then call him, but have a reason.

365
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:27,447
- We're on the paper together.
- Perfect.

366
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:29,992
Call to ask for notes or something. But don't give him anything else.

367
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:33,413
If he's into you, he'll take it from there. If he's not, at least you know, so you can dump him.

368
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:36,070
Direct, simple. A clear path. Thank you.

369
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:37,038
You're welcome.

370
00:17:37,866 --> 00:17:40,026
- Um, excuse me.
- Yeah?

371
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:42,029
If you don't mind, I'm wondering -

372
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:42,869
Yeah?

373
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,787
Okay, I got close to kind of getting together with a guy -

374
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:47,405
You mean like 'getting together', getting together?

375
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:49,261
Yeah. But, we were interrupted.

376
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:53,042
Shouldn't he be calling me to talk, or maybe set up getting together?

377
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,117
What was the interruption?

378
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:54,953
Mom.

379
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:57,410
Then Dad. Then Mom's boyfriend.

380
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:58,664
- Whoa.
- Poor guy.

381
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:00,205
Okay, you definitely have to call him.

382
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:00,858
Really?

383
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:01,951
He might be afraid to call.

384
00:18:02,017 --> 00:18:03,190
Thinks you're too much drama.

385
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:04,229
Too much drama.

386
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:06,176
You give him a call, but keep it casual.

387
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,199
She's love dense. Give her specific language.

388
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,621
- Get together?
- Or hang out?

389
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:10,507
That's better.

390
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:12,052
Ask him to hang out sometime.

391
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:16,331
It'll give him an easy out. If he says yes, meet up, act casual, but look hot.

392
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,726
I've got a pen if you want to write this down.

393
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,800
No, I think I can remember. Thank you.

394
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,049
- No problem.
- Anytime.

395
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,068
Styrofoam for brains, but they know their stuff.

396
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,440
I'm on your side, Lorelai.

397
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:44,493
Whoa, yo, Gypsy. What are you talking about?

398
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,835
- The breakup.
- What breakup?

399
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:47,826
- Yours and Luke's.
- We're not broken up.

400
00:18:47,888 --> 00:18:50,072
Break up, split up, separated - whatever you want to call it.

401
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:52,989
I'd like to call it nothing. We're fine. What is with these ribbons?

402
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:55,394
Pink for you, blue for Luke. Taylor's idea.

403
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,092
That way we all know whose side we're on without having to talk to each other.

404
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:00,156
- He's a freak, but I like pink.
- Oh my God.

405
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:01,558
Look out, blue incoming.

406
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:05,798
Oh, Gypsy, please. Take that ribbon off. I don't want anyone encouraging Taylor on this.

407
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,932
Oh, it's way too late. He's passed out hundreds.

408
00:19:08,117 --> 00:19:09,004
Hundreds?

409
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:12,070
It was no choice for me. Luke fixes his own truck, so I make bumpkins off him.

410
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:14,389
But you, you don't know a piston from a pepperoni.

411
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:16,290
Lots of money in ignorance. I'm with you.

412
00:19:16,391 --> 00:19:18,173
Okay, great. I'll catch up with you later.

413
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:22,070
Pink power, baby. We chicks gotta stick together.

414
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:26,795
Lorelai.

415
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:31,469
I'll deal with you later. Luke? Hi. I'm sorry to sneak up on you like this,

416
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,793
but please, just give me a minute. We need to talk. I have so much to say.

417
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,878
I should have told you about that night with Christopher. I know that now.

418
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,081
Yeah, okay. I'm -

419
00:19:41,157 --> 00:19:44,495
But I swear, the visit we had was so innocent. It was about his dad,

420
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:46,949
and nothing happened. Less than nothing happened.

421
00:19:47,014 --> 00:19:47,736
But you hid it.

422
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,366
I know, and I shouldn't have. And I am so, so sorry.

423
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:55,431
But all that talk from Christopher, at the wedding. I didn't see that coming.

424
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:58,172
He was drunk. He was stupid.

425
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,110
He's never not stupid, but I didn't see it coming.

426
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:01,893
You should have.

427
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:05,257
I know. Rory warned me and I ignored her, but believe me.

428
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,346
I am never seeing him again. Never.

429
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:10,346
What are you talking about? He's Rory's father. He'll always be in your life.

430
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:11,232
In her life.

431
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:12,773
Her life is your life.

432
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,915
Not when it comes to this.

433
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:15,421
This is going to happen again and again.

434
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:16,788
No, it won't, Luke. I promise.

435
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:21,089
God, if you care anything for me at all, just please trust me on this.

436
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:21,795
I've got to go.

437
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:24,156
Luke. No, wait. Wait.

438
00:20:24,247 --> 00:20:27,078
Luke, it was my mother, you know, who did all this. She was the one.

439
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:30,546
She caused all this hateful stuff because Christopher is weak and she knows that

440
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:32,193
and I am never talking to her again.

441
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:33,587
They're always going to be in your life too.

442
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:37,426
Your mother, your father. The Gilmores will always be in your life.

443
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:38,625
I can cut them off.

444
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,764
No, you just can't cut them off. It doesn't work that way,

445
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,858
and they'll never feel differently about me, ever.

446
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:46,633
It doesn't matter, because they're gone. That's it. They are gone. I can do that.

447
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:49,724
- I can't have this out right now.
- Okay, when? Where?

448
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,475
I need more time! I told you that.

449
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:56,801
I'm afraid of this 'more time' stuff. I'm afraid it'll take forty years and that's not good.

450
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:57,277
Lorelai.

451
00:20:57,338 --> 00:21:00,092
We'll miss our middle. I want a middle.

452
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,903
And the town is dividing us up. I need that to stop.

453
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:03,540
Don't.

454
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:07,041
Luke. I am all in. I'm all in.

455
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:12,237
Please trust me. Let me show you what a great girlfriend I can be.

456
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:16,165
But I can't wait. We can't wait. I need to know what you're thinking right now.

457
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:18,285
Fine. You want to know what I'm thinking right now?

458
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:20,932
That I can't be in this relationship. It's too much.

459
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,041
No.

460
00:21:31,729 --> 00:21:33,819
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Rory.

461
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:36,470
Rory Gilmore, as I live and breathe.

462
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,863
So, how are you?

463
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,216
I'm good, Ace, how are you?

464
00:21:39,557 --> 00:21:40,285
I'm good.

465
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:42,537
Hope your life's been less exciting since the last time I saw you.

466
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,505
Relatively.

467
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:45,580
Meaning you're steering clear of country club dressing rooms?

468
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:47,224
- Pretty much.
- Good.

469
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:53,029
Yeah. So, I was wondering if maybe you -

470
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:54,207
Yeah?

471
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:57,765
If you'd like to hang out, or something.

472
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:59,690
- Hang out?
- Yeah.

473
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:00,402
When?

474
00:22:00,663 --> 00:22:01,938
How about tonight?

475
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:03,745
Whoa, spontaneity.

476
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,963
I'm very 'of the moment' these days.

477
00:22:06,315 --> 00:22:09,173
Well, sure, I'd love to hang out with you. Come on over.

478
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:11,174
- To your place?
- Absolutely.

479
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:12,425
Cool.

480
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,031
- See you in a bit.
- See you in a bit.

481
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:25,538
Yeah.

482
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:28,153
Oh, hi. I don't think I'm in the right place.

483
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:29,729
- Hey, who is it?
- Girl scout.

484
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:31,666
- Hey, Ace. Come on in.
- Come on in.

485
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,624
Welcome to my night of humiliating defeat.

486
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:35,555
One in a series.

487
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:37,793
- Don't gloat, Robert. It's not Christian.
- Neither am I.

488
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:39,519
- Everybody, this is Rory.
- Hi.

489
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:40,174
Hey.

490
00:22:40,267 --> 00:22:41,721
I'd introduce you, but I only know three of them.

491
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:42,710
It's to you, buddy.

492
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,766
Oh, joy. Come on, kiddo, sit here next to me.

493
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:46,924
- Is that allowed?
- I wouldn't object.

494
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:49,442
Come on, be my good luck charm. Did I raise or check?

495
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:51,192
You been eating out of aluminum pans again, buddy?

496
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,833
Your short term memory is non-existent.

497
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:54,132
Yeah, it's aluminum pans.

498
00:22:54,188 --> 00:22:55,928
The more you stall, the slower I win.

499
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:57,332
That was almost grammatically correct.

500
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:58,249
- Two.
- Call.

501
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,736
- Hold up. You look very nice tonight.
- Oh, thanks.

502
00:23:01,822 --> 00:23:02,855
What do you know about this game?

503
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,626
Um, just what I've seen on T.V. The Odd Couple.

504
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,485
What?

505
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:10,075
Quincy played it, but he wasn't called Quincy, um, Oscar and Felix.

506
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,183
Felix didn't play it. Tony Randall, he cooked for them sometimes.

507
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,175
- I am so lost.
- I know a little.

508
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:18,401
Well, if you know anything, you know I need a jack or a ten.

509
00:23:19,252 --> 00:23:20,931
- Pocket jacks.
- Un bloody believable.

510
00:23:21,012 --> 00:23:22,580
- Do we bother with fifth street?
- Let's see it.

511
00:23:23,254 --> 00:23:25,666
Oh, now you're just mocking me!

512
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,519
Well, your gal brought someone some luck.

513
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:29,235
Two g's. Ouch.

514
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,965
That was two thousand dollars?

515
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:32,614
- Got to bet it to win it.
- It's just money.

516
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:34,355
He's down nine to me from last time.

517
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:37,653
Should I send an I.O.U. to your Pop, that how you want to work it? Cut out the middle man?

518
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:39,081
Yeah, and I'll send some to your mother.

519
00:23:39,857 --> 00:23:42,966
Generic, unfocused 'and-so's-your-mother' style comeback.

520
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,155
You're off your game, Huntz.

521
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:46,173
I'll work on a better retort and get back to you.

522
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:47,134
So are you covering this?

523
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:47,898
Pardon me?

524
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:50,272
You were at the last Life and Death shindig, as I recall.

525
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,690
Yeah, but I'm not covering this. I'm just hanging out.

526
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:54,963
Yeah, back off, Robert. She's just hanging out.

527
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,346
- Thanks, kid.
- Oh, you're welcome.

528
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:57,949
- I love the service here.
- I'm out.

529
00:23:58,025 --> 00:23:59,515
- Down to the tricks again.
- I'm in.

530
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:01,353
- Don't be a jerk, Robert.
- What?

531
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:03,407
You bet without looking at your cards. Look at your cards.

532
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,578
- I don't need to, with Rory here.
- I hate it when he does that.

533
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:06,699
You want a drink?

534
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:07,807
- Me?
- Yeah.

535
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:12,069
Well, actually I don't know how long I'm going to stay here so I think I'm good for now.

536
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:12,929
All right.

537
00:24:13,343 --> 00:24:16,263
Well, the way it's going tonight, I may not last till the next drink either.

538
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:18,142
- Can we change the music?
- No.

539
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,437
Since when did you become Tipper Gore?

540
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:20,324
Shut up, Colin.

541
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:23,103
- She's on her way, I know she is.
- Well, I hope she is.

542
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:27,323
Just hang in there, girls. I know you're hungry. They're getting ready to rebel.

543
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,832
It's just that Lorelai ordered all the tables and the little china

544
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:33,129
and I'm sure it's here somewhere, it's just - excuse me for just a second.

545
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,028
Please, help. You're just standing there.

546
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,673
I'm staying out of the way. In situations like this, 'do not get in the way' is so valuable.

547
00:24:39,743 --> 00:24:41,258
Well, get in the way. Entertain the kids.

548
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:44,270
Like I'm Sponge Boy Big Pants or something? I do not entertain children.

549
00:24:44,347 --> 00:24:47,203
I'm getting worried. She left to do an errand yesterday and never came back.

550
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,892
Are you dialing the right number?

551
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,976
I think after ten years I know Lorelai's number.

552
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,680
- Well, where is she?
- I don't know.

553
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:55,098
But she was in charge of everything except the pancakes, and without her

554
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,431
all we have are pancakes! They're expecting games and stuff.

555
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:00,848
Oh, here's a fun game. Poke out all of the doll's eyes,

556
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,300
mix them up, and match them to the right dolls.

557
00:25:03,695 --> 00:25:05,328
- It's still voicemail!
- Well, leave a message!

558
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:07,571
I've left a million messages! I'm going to her house.

559
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:09,793
- Don't leave me here!
- Stall, stall!

560
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,650
My dolly fell. Kiss the boo-boo.

561
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,319
What part of the dolly is the boo-boo?

562
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:26,775
Come on, come on.

563
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:27,928
I've made my decision.

564
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:29,472
I'm in. Three fifty.

565
00:25:29,643 --> 00:25:30,278
Call.

566
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:31,807
- I'm going to raise.
- Ass.

567
00:25:32,152 --> 00:25:34,482
Our gentleman's courtesies still prevail, Rob.

568
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:37,616
Fine. Mr. Ass. Ass Esquire.

569
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:40,518
He's cracked! We've cracked Robert!

570
00:25:40,887 --> 00:25:42,495
Mornin' there, Ace, how'd you sleep?

571
00:25:42,577 --> 00:25:43,816
For the record you don't snore.

572
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:47,358
We'd be happy to sign an affidavit to that effect for any prospective husband.

573
00:25:50,763 --> 00:25:52,833
- Mom?
- It's me, Rory. It's Sookie.

574
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:54,860
Sookie? Are you at the house?

575
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:58,597
Look, uh, something happened with your mom and Luke and your mom's in bad shape.

576
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:02,878
I mean, she's down, hon. And I'm here now, but I think you oughta come.

577
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:03,773
She needs you.

578
00:26:03,865 --> 00:26:05,243
Oh my God. Is she hurt?

579
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:07,169
No, not physically. Just come, okay?

580
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:07,921
I'm coming.

581
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,045
I'm out.

582
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,225
- You okay?
- I have to go.

583
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:13,911
What happened?

584
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:15,704
I just have to go, I have to get home.

585
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,964
- To your dorm?
- Stars Hollow.

586
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:20,050
Oh, no, I don't have my car.

587
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:21,652
Well, didn't you walk here, like a hundred yards away?

588
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,170
No, I mean I took it in for it's six month service. It's at the dealer.

589
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:27,536
You take your car to the dealer? They so rip you off there!

590
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:29,465
Well it doesn't matter where it is! I don't have it!

591
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:32,066
Which means that I have to take a bus or a train or something.

592
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:34,289
- That'll take hours.
- I know. I have to go.

593
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,129
Take my car.

594
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:36,865
I don't want to drive your car.

595
00:26:36,946 --> 00:26:39,521
No, it's a car with a driver. I've got an account with the company.

596
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:40,079
No.

597
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:42,502
Take it. I'll give Frank a call, tell him to meet you out front.

598
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:44,401
He'll take good care of you. It's a done deal.

599
00:26:44,488 --> 00:26:46,086
Okay. Thanks.

600
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:46,926
Go!

601
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,582
- Where is she?
- Upstairs.

602
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,742
Okay, I've got it from here, Sookie. I love you.

603
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,627
Mom? What happened?

604
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:02,992
Luke.

605
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:04,179
What Luke?

606
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,033
He's gone! He hates me.

607
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:08,162
I blew it. I blew everything.

608
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,153
I don't understand. What happened?

609
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,222
I should have told him about Christopher.

610
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:13,273
That was innocent.

611
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,397
But I should have told him. I hid it.

612
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:16,960
I shouldn't have hid it.

613
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:18,172
Try to sit up.

614
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:19,427
She got to him.

615
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:20,712
To Dad? Who did?

616
00:27:20,803 --> 00:27:23,308
Mom. She pushed him and it ruined everything.

617
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,967
And now they're putting up ribbons.

618
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:26,345
Ribbons? Who?

619
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:27,993
Taylor, the town. They hate me.

620
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,986
They all hate me. I wrecked everything.

621
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:32,709
Mom. This isn't good. Come on. Try to sit up.

622
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:35,540
He said he needed time to think, but I pushed him.

623
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:36,609
He'll come around.

624
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:39,682
I pushed him, and now he's gone.

625
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:43,088
He waited forever for you. He's not just going to walk away.

626
00:27:43,282 --> 00:27:44,381
It's over.

627
00:27:44,571 --> 00:27:45,934
Mom, this isn't you.

628
00:27:46,184 --> 00:27:48,278
Lying in bed like this. You should be up.

629
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,341
You should go to school. Go back to school.

630
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,791
I'm here. I'm staying.

631
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,823
God, I really screwed up this time.

632
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:58,226
He could have been the one.

633
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,219
He'll come around. Shh.

634
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:03,746
Try to sleep.

635
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:15,288
Rory?

636
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,077
Luke?

637
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:45,526
Whatcha watching?

638
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,144
Something stupid.

639
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:55,274
This isn't stupid.

640
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:00,522
Lorelai, this thing we're doing here, me, you.

641
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:04,675
I just want you to know I'm in.

642
00:29:05,217 --> 00:29:06,554
I am all in.

643
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:14,490
Say something.

644
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:24,013
Say something!

645
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:33,332
You slept.

646
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:34,304
I guess.

647
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:35,441
Feeling better?

648
00:29:35,682 --> 00:29:36,444
Sure.

649
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:37,551
No you're not.

650
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:39,260
You should get back to Yale.

651
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:42,456
Rory, you can't just stay here.

652
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:44,376
- Sorry. I'm here for the duration.
- No.

653
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:46,527
- You need supplies.
- I'm fine.

654
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:49,752
There's no sign that you've eaten or had anything to drink.

655
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,499
Well, I'm not hungry or thirsty.

656
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,570
Well, if you're staying up here you need supplies. Sustenance. Entertainment.

657
00:29:54,642 --> 00:29:55,276
Well.

658
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:57,606
See, you're a little thirsty, aren't you.

659
00:29:58,435 --> 00:29:59,198
A little.

660
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,211
What can I get you? Water? Bourbon?

661
00:30:01,297 --> 00:30:01,995
Water is good.

662
00:30:02,097 --> 00:30:02,997
What do you got food-wise?

663
00:30:03,074 --> 00:30:03,719
Not much.

664
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:04,594
What's not much?

665
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,646
Like, nothing. Some moldy bread. I've been eating out mostly.

666
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:08,967
Okay, I'm going on a run.

667
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:10,170
I'm not hungry.

668
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,151
I'll get you some DVD's, too. Do you want magazines?

669
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:13,852
No.

670
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,028
I'll get you some magazines. You sure you don't want bourbon?

671
00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:17,417
Honey, you have stuff to do.

672
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:19,356
This is my stuff. I'll be back in a flash.

673
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,301
- The ribbons.
- What?

674
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:23,990
Ah, the ribbons. They're all over town.

675
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,150
I'll just ignore them. Stupid Taylor!

676
00:30:26,227 --> 00:30:28,168
People are going to be all over you with questions.

677
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,078
Then they'll feel the wrath of the Green Destiny.

678
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:31,291
Oh, you'll get bombarded.

679
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:33,288
Well, maybe I'll call in some reinforcements.

680
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:35,483
- I've got my cell on.
- 'Kay.

681
00:30:35,577 --> 00:30:38,152
Don't go rollerblading or bowling or anything while I'm gone.

682
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:38,859
I won't.

683
00:30:45,981 --> 00:30:47,035
I'll get those, Miss.

684
00:30:52,565 --> 00:30:54,623
- Did you get everything?
- Everything on the list.

685
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:56,343
Plus, I threw in a few things of my own.

686
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:59,359
Some Toll House cookie dough. Cooked or uncooked, the ultimate comfort food.

687
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:00,142
Nice.

688
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,170
Chocolate covered matzah.

689
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:02,384
Nice and ethnic.

690
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:03,332
And a new toothbrush.

691
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,217
Why a new toothbrush?

692
00:31:04,372 --> 00:31:07,019
Dentists say you're supposed to change your toothbrush every three months,

693
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,729
and I'm assuming your mother's not doing that.

694
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,821
Well, I'm not sure how that's going to help her depression but you are a good friend.

695
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:13,874
You like ham and cheese, Frank?

696
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:14,909
Ah, thank you, Miss.

697
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:15,871
We can head home now.

698
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:16,691
Very good.

699
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:18,641
Was Taylor in there?

700
00:31:18,697 --> 00:31:20,475
'Fraid so. And he was holding court.

701
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:21,192
What?

702
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:25,072
He was talking with a bunch of people about the breakup. Big debate going on.

703
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:25,952
What debate?

704
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,584
Oh, about whether Elm should have gone more pink than blue,

705
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:31,478
and whether Lorelai should have married that Max guy when she had the chance.

706
00:31:31,548 --> 00:31:34,114
Oh, and he was passing out ribbons like there was no tomorrow.

707
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,062
Was he.

708
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:37,744
- Hold on, Frank.
- Yes, ma'am.

709
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:42,997
Luke I've known longer, because of the diner. Lorelai is much later, but she -

710
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,416
- Where are they, Taylor?
- What?

711
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,130
Don't play dumb. The ribbons.

712
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:49,290
Take piano lessons or something!

713
00:31:50,595 --> 00:31:52,413
She was so sweet when she was little.

714
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:53,928
Got 'em.

715
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:55,762
My compliments to your moxie!

716
00:31:55,844 --> 00:31:57,850
Oh, I've got moxie coming out of my ears today.

717
00:31:59,699 --> 00:32:00,831
They honking at us?

718
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:04,737
They better not be. Frank, are they honking at us?

719
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:05,705
I believe so.

720
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:10,041
Oh, I am in no mood for this. We are depressed!

721
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:12,832
We'll move when we move, so stop -

722
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:18,228
Oh. Sorry.

723
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:20,440
I'm not usually in a limo.

724
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,203
Heads up, man coming in.

725
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:34,633
Oh! The T.V.!

726
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:37,193
You won't come downstairs, I'm bringing downstairs up to you.

727
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:38,739
- On the table, Frank.
- Very good.

728
00:32:38,811 --> 00:32:39,989
- Evening, Ma'am.
- Evening.

729
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:41,699
That's Frank, my driver.

730
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:47,141
So, I put all the things you will definitely need within easiest reach - water, basic foodstuffs -

731
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:52,733
then, the things that you have to reach for or stand up for recede in order of frequency of use.

732
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:54,527
It's not a science, but I did the best I could.

733
00:32:54,568 --> 00:32:57,458
Well, I'm loving the cereal combo.

734
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,738
Five different kinds, three sweetened,

735
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:03,259
with a mix of non-fat milk and half and half. It's a Paris recipe.

736
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,042
Thank her for me.

737
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:05,373
- All done here.
- Excellent.

738
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:06,623
Anything else I can get for you?

739
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:08,045
I don't think so. Thanks, Frank.

740
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,194
Yeah, thanks, Frank.

741
00:33:10,175 --> 00:33:11,470
Wait, who's Frank?

742
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:15,628
Oh, well, I had to get out here, and my car is at the dealer for it's six month service.

743
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,976
So my friend had a car and a driver standing by, so they let me borrow it

744
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:22,245
and Frank, and, well, that explains Frank.

745
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:24,179
- You take your car to the dealer?
- Yeah.

746
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:25,295
They're such a rip-off there.

747
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:26,910
It says in the book to take it to the dealer.

748
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:29,113
If it said in the book to drive off a cliff, would you drive off a cliff?

749
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:29,806
Yes I would.

750
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:31,574
And 'they' is a 'he'.

751
00:33:31,696 --> 00:33:32,305
Who?

752
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:34,067
The 'they' with the limo.

753
00:33:34,255 --> 00:33:35,372
Yes, he's a 'he'.

754
00:33:35,526 --> 00:33:37,190
- Thank Logan for me.
- Okay.

755
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:39,288
Look, you and Frank should go.

756
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:39,923
No!

757
00:33:40,114 --> 00:33:41,188
Yale's going to get mad.

758
00:33:41,347 --> 00:33:42,562
Yale's not going to get mad.

759
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:45,253
Rory, I'm glad you came, but look how fine I am.

760
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,534
I'm surrounded by everything I could possibly need.

761
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:49,258
I even have raw cookie dough, for God's sake.

762
00:33:49,315 --> 00:33:50,282
That was Lane's idea.

763
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:52,781
A whole village has seen to my needs.

764
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:55,453
Go. It's time. Look, I'm sitting up and everything.

765
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,848
And you're feeling better, I mean, for real this time?

766
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,896
I'm not a hundred percent, but I'm getting there. I swear.

767
00:34:00,982 --> 00:34:03,261
The downstairs is all set too. I cleaned up.

768
00:34:03,466 --> 00:34:06,962
Vacuumed a little, spot dusted. Oh, and I've checked in with Sookie.

769
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:07,608
Oh, good.

770
00:34:07,684 --> 00:34:09,378
The party for the little girls and their dolls?

771
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,456
Michel apparently really came through and it was a big hit. He sang a medley from Annie.

772
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,617
Oh, the big guns. Good. Now go!

773
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:18,197
Okay. But I am going to call a lot.

774
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,016
I'm good with that.

775
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:22,789
And I only have one class tomorrow, so I could stop by again in the afternoon.

776
00:34:22,856 --> 00:34:23,901
Well, there'll be no need.

777
00:34:23,976 --> 00:34:25,125
You can call me, too, you know.

778
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,961
I know, Mom.

779
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:28,043
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye, honey.

780
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:31,943
And I'm going to have Frank honk before we leave.

781
00:34:32,092 --> 00:34:32,671
Why?

782
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,432
- I don't know, it just sounds fun.
- Okay.

783
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:24,358
Hey, Luke, it's me.

784
00:35:26,263 --> 00:35:31,049
I know I'm not supposed to be calling, but I am not doing really great right now, and -

785
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:39,047
I was just wondering, if, do you remember in The Way we Were,

786
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:43,860
how Katie and Hubbell broke up because his friends were joking and laughing,

787
00:35:43,937 --> 00:35:45,979
and the president had just died, and...

788
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:50,439
she yelled at them and he was mad and he was going out to Hollywood,

789
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:54,351
and, I mean, which she hated, and...

790
00:35:54,842 --> 00:36:01,324
and... he broke up with her and she was really... upset.

791
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,528
And she called him and asked him if he would come over and sit with her

792
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,943
because he was her best friend and she needed her best friend, and he did.

793
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:13,377
And...

794
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:18,261
and they talked all night,

795
00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:24,677
and they went out to Hollywood, which was a disaster, but it was good at first.

796
00:36:25,112 --> 00:36:27,288
With the boat, and uh...

797
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:31,830
and putting the books away.

798
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,204
I've seen this movie a lot, so if you don't remember the putting the books away scene,

799
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:40,007
don't feel stupid or anything. I was just sitting here thinking about it, because I, um,

800
00:36:40,785 --> 00:36:44,824
I'm in my house, and I was just, uh -

801
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:51,763
Could - please come over. I - please.

802
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:55,746
Really need to see you and talk to you, and -

803
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,883
please - come over.

804
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:01,615
Please.

805
00:37:04,004 --> 00:37:04,578
Come -

806
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:11,761
Oh, my God.

807
00:37:55,313 --> 00:37:56,628
- Hey, Ace, how you doing?
- Fine.

808
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,304
Come on in.

809
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:01,215
Um, Logan, wait. No, I can't stay, I'm just returning Frank.

810
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,592
Returning Frank?

811
00:38:02,685 --> 00:38:04,165
And the limo. Thanks very much.

812
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:05,183
Everything okay back home?

813
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:07,898
Okay enough. It was good that I went.

814
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:09,163
Thank you very much for your help.

815
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:11,005
- You're very formal tonight.
- What?

816
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,458
Just your tone. It's formal.

817
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:17,549
Well, that's how it is. And, I fed Frank a nice sandwich, so he's all good to go.

818
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:19,659
You know you ended up being extremely lucky for me, Ace.

819
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,364
Is that so?

820
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:23,288
I took Robert for everything he had, plus everything I owed him from last time.

821
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,547
You should come to all these things.

822
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:26,273
Yeah, kiddo, maybe I should.

823
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,267
What?

824
00:38:27,492 --> 00:38:30,840
Hey, did it ever occur to you when I called to ask you if you wanted to hang out

825
00:38:30,907 --> 00:38:32,878
that I meant that it should just be the two of us?

826
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:34,675
I actually wasn't sure, the whole thing was a little vague.

827
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:35,710
It wasn't vague.

828
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:38,707
No, hanging out's a little vague. It's not a specific boy-girl thing.

829
00:38:38,787 --> 00:38:42,827
Well, I can tell you that I wasn't expecting to be Fanny Brice to your Nicky Arnstein.

830
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:45,166
But I already had this game going, and I couldn't just kick everybody out,

831
00:38:45,227 --> 00:38:48,868
so my choice is to say no and not see you at all or say yes and do it the way we did it.

832
00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:50,685
Well, I wasn't expecting a group.

833
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:53,225
So, I should have said no, meaning I wouldn't see you at all?

834
00:38:53,322 --> 00:38:54,182
I wanted to see you.

835
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:55,790
Well, that's nice. I wanted to see you too.

836
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:58,202
I just thought it would be a little more intimate.

837
00:38:58,299 --> 00:38:58,996
Intimate?

838
00:38:59,067 --> 00:38:59,911
You know what I mean.

839
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:01,771
So the only time we can see each other is to have sex?

840
00:39:01,848 --> 00:39:03,388
No, Logan, that's not what I'm saying.

841
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:04,473
That's what I'm taking from this.

842
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,113
Well, don't take that. That's not what I'm saying.

843
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:09,620
So, we can see each other under all kinds of conditions. Alone, in a group.

844
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:10,341
Yeah.

845
00:39:10,424 --> 00:39:12,067
Good. Last night happened to be a group thing.

846
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:12,651
Right.

847
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:13,639
So I don't see the problem.

848
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:17,678
Yeah. No, I guess there really wasn't a problem.

849
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,012
- Glad we cleared that up.
- Yeah, me too.

850
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:23,275
Now, I'm going out of town for a few days, but I was going to give you a call

851
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:25,461
to set something up for when I get back, but you called me first.

852
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:26,117
Right.

853
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:29,628
I'm back next Saturday. It's the first night I'm back. Want to -

854
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:33,121
I don't know, what are the kids saying these days? Hang out?

855
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,859
I'm never listening to the breakfast cereal girls again.

856
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:36,603
What?

857
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,957
Nothing. I'm free.

858
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:40,335
No group this time.

859
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:41,707
No group this time.

860
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:42,977
Good, so next Saturday.

861
00:39:47,236 --> 00:39:48,635
Thanks for feeding Frank.

862
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:49,888
You're welcome.

863
00:39:50,082 --> 00:39:53,857
And I promise not to call you kiddo again, I kinda picked up on that sarcasm from before.

864
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,211
There are just so many other things you could call me.

865
00:39:56,298 --> 00:39:57,292
That's an opening.

866
00:39:59,715 --> 00:40:00,540
Bye.

867
00:40:00,892 --> 00:40:01,674
Bye, Ace.

868
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:10,184
- Luke.
- Are you okay?

869
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:10,932
Yeah, I -

870
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,571
Sure? I got here, there was no answer.

871
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:15,212
You got my message.

872
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:19,646
Yeah, I was home and I couldn't reach the phone, so I ran over here.

873
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:22,006
I knocked, there was no answer, so I tried the loose window,

874
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:25,658
but I fixed that last week, and then I realized I fixed all the stupid ways there were

875
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:29,452
to get in your house, and I broke the back door lock and I ran inside and you weren't there.

876
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:31,940
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay, I can fix it.

877
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:35,387
I'm so sorry, Luke. I will never do this to you ever again.

878
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,655
I am absolutely humiliated.

879
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:41,544
I was hurting, and I knew if I called you you'd come.

880
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:43,199
- I never should have done that.
- It's okay.

881
00:40:43,281 --> 00:40:45,677
No, it's not okay. It's not okay. I am not that girl.

882
00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:47,890
I am not the one who cries and falls apart

883
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:53,879
and calls her ex-boyfriend to come and save her.

884
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:58,135
Thank you so much for coming, and for breaking my door.

885
00:40:58,216 --> 00:40:59,829
You're an amazing guy for doing that.

886
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:01,488
What's that?

887
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:05,691
It's the tape from your answering machine.

888
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:06,966
From my answering machine?

889
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:10,539
The last crazy thing you will ever have to endure from me, I promise.

890
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:15,338
I just want you to know that I heard you when you said that you're out. I did.

891
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,835
I'm going to respect that from now on.

892
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,670
Okay.

893
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:24,165
You should go. It's cold.

894
00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:26,187
I'll be fine.

895
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:39,121
