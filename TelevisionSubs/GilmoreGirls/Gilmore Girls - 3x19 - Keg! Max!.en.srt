1
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:47,087
Oh, I know! How about... no.

2
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:49,892
No, no, you can't keep doing that.

3
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,888
You can't just start a thought and then say no.

4
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:53,819
Finish them or don't start them at all.

5
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:56,149
You're very totalitarian today.

6
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,399
No, it just drives me crazy.

7
00:00:57,502 --> 00:01:00,431
It's like if you do "shave and a haircut" without the last part, you know?

8
00:01:01,372 --> 00:01:02,372
Come on, do it.

9
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,177
Will you stop giving me half-finished thoughts?

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,372
I promise. Come on, do it.

11
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,260
- Two bits. 
- Thank you.

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,386
Now what were you thinking?

13
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:12,339
- Pizza and TV. 
- That's our fallback.

14
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:14,796
That's why I said not, I remembered it was our fallback.

15
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,660
When did we become so old and pathetic?

16
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:18,151
Hey, hey, we're neither.

17
00:01:18,483 --> 00:01:20,669
We're momentarily stuck on what to do tonight.

18
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:22,350
It's a Friday night. We should be out,

19
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:23,972
I don't know, partying with the homies.

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,553
Our Stars Hollow homies are all in bed by now.

21
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:29,483
Not Kirk. He'll be playing video trivia at the pizza place.

22
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,354
We could go and watch.

23
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:32,847
Okay, we're old and pathetic. How did it come to this?

24
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:34,894
Well, it's our first Friday night that we haven't had

25
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,482
to go to Grandma and Grandpa's for dinner.

26
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:38,259
I cannot for the life of me remember

27
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,349
what we did before we started doing those.

28
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,013
It feels like a million years ago.

29
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,651
Ooh, who are you calling?

30
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:47,014
It just feels weird for me not even to say hello to them on a Friday night.

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,408
No, don't call them.

32
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,582
Hey, this rift is between you and them.

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,884
I'm still on friendly terms.

34
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,731
I know, it's just that they're probably sitting there eating alone,

35
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,116
shivering in an unheated room, the only illumination a single light bulb

36
00:01:58,177 --> 00:02:00,654
just so they can make us feel spectacularly guilty at the thought.

37
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:02,140
Hey Grandpa, it's Rory...

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,152
Rory.

39
00:02:04,546 --> 00:02:05,959
He's pretending not to remember you?

40
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:08,101
- No, it's loud there. 
- Loud?

41
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,224
- What's going on there? 
- Oh, we're having a party.

42
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:12,625
- A party? 
- A party?

43
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,012
Sort of a last minute thing.

44
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:15,396
Couldn't get too big a crowd here.

45
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:18,705
I think we wound up with 55 or 60, something like that.

46
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:20,077
60 people.

47
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,852
Oh, here come the mushroom caps everybody!

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,613
There's singing and mushroom caps.

49
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,137
- I am appalled by this. 
- Sounds like a lot of fun.

50
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,830
Oh, it is. Oh, now, your grandmother would come and say hello,

51
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:31,875
but she's in the next room dancing with Lloyd Sandstone.

52
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,911
Watch where you put those hands, Lloyd.

53
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,986
A guy named Lloyd is feeling up Grandma.

54
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:36,948
You're making this up.

55
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:39,814
Well, I'll let you go, okay?

56
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:43,328
Okay. Now, you're coming to visit after school on Monday, aren't ya?

57
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,536
Yes, I'll see you then.

58
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,165
Ah, can't wait. Bye now.

59
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:52,839
The Gilmore house is partying like it's 1999.

60
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:54,703
How could they bounce back so quickly?

61
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:56,416
I don't know, but bounce they did.

62
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,327
Okay, they win this time.

63
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:01,851
But we've gotta think of something super big and fantastic

64
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:03,796
and cool for next Friday night, okay?

65
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:05,250
- Okay. 
- Now think.

66
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:11,230
Mushroom caps sound really good.

67
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:12,869
Sorry.

68
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,161
- Hi. 
- Say cheese.

69
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:24,663
I love my little digital camera. I wanna marry it.

70
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,708
Do you ever wanna put it away?

71
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:28,259
Oh, you'll hurt little DigitalDan's feelings.

72
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:29,278
Sorry, D.D.

73
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:31,750
Gotcha! Oh, no, wait.

74
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:35,206
Oh, missed. Got a good one of you, though. Nice cheekbones.

75
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,695
So, could you focus on something non-photographic for a second?

76
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:38,950
I'll try.

77
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:40,751
I was asked to pass this along to you.

78
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:42,395
Something from Chilton?

79
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,627
You've been dipping girls' hair in the inkwells again?

80
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:45,631
Read it and see.

81
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:50,080
"Dear Ms. Gilmore, with your daughter's final days of Chilton fast approaching,

82
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,601
yours are, too." Hm, not feeling the love here.

83
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:56,098
Yadda, yadda, yadda. "The Booster Club could use your help.

84
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,991
We would greatly appreciate - " Greatly's underlined three times.

85
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:01,807
Trying to emphasize the word there. Got it, guys. Thanks.

86
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:05,473
"- your involvement, especially in light of your previous paucity of participation."

87
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:09,079
Ooh, they got me with alliteration and an obscure word.

88
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,188
The bastards.

89
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,708
I've been summoned to duty.

90
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:12,514
Sounds like it.

91
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,549
I feel like I should pack my rucksack, kiss my loved ones goodbye.

92
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,779
So, don't do it, then.

93
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,350
Yeah, you're as good as outta there.

94
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,240
Yale's grabbed you. It's too late. We don't need anything from Chilton.

95
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,149
- Except my graduation tickets. 
- We already got 'em.

96
00:05:24,263 --> 00:05:27,755
But we need extras. I just put in the request, and it's up to them now.

97
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,634
So we do need one kind of big thing.

98
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:31,523
And then there's my diploma.

99
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:32,578
You'll get your diploma at graduation.

100
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,708
No, I get my diploma holder at graduation.

101
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,998
Do you think they would withhold your diploma based

102
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,599
on my participation paucity?

103
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:39,481
I don't know.

104
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,974
Oh man, I'm screwed. I guess I gotta do it.

105
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,099
Hey guys.

106
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:45,475
Was that necessary?

107
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:48,563
- Oh man, you do not photograph well. 
- What?

108
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,192
You've been getting some sleep, brother?

109
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:51,784
'Cause that's forty miles bad running.

110
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,949
I wasn't ready. Plus, it was a bad angle. Plus, this is a harsh light.

111
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:57,954
A soft light would help with the thing with the eyes.

112
00:05:58,072 --> 00:05:59,833
Look who knows what light he looks best in.

113
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:00,848
You ready to order?

114
00:06:01,262 --> 00:06:04,401
I'm gonna take a picture of the menu and then order off the camera.

115
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,391
- Yell when she's tired of the thing. 
- Give it time.

116
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:09,822
Now I'm gonna zoom in on just the breakfast meats.

117
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,925
Go to town.

118
00:06:14,222 --> 00:06:16,301
- Whoa, cool. 
- We all finished at the same time.

119
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:17,390
That has never happened.

120
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:19,593
The middle of that song didn't even sound like us.

121
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:20,724
Yeah, it sounded good.

122
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:22,736
It sounded great, guys. All of it. Didn't it?

123
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:25,891
- Not too shabby. 
- We are so ready for this gig.

124
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:27,852
We've got a gig. I just love the sound of that.

125
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,403
- Where is it? 
- Kyle from school.

126
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:31,194
His parents are going to Marriage Encounter for the weekend

127
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,368
so he's throwing this mondo party.

128
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:33,391
You got enough songs?

129
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:36,050
We have enough for two half-hour sets. What we need is a name.

130
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,315
I made my suggestion.

131
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:39,675
Yeah, and we vetoed "The Harry Potters." Next.

132
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:40,576
So yours is better?

133
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:43,409
"Follow Them to the Edge of the Dessert" is memorable and classy.

134
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:45,362
I run out of breath every time I say it.

135
00:06:45,466 --> 00:06:47,703
You've got asthma, dude. You run out of breath saying your name.

136
00:06:47,843 --> 00:06:50,842
Yeah, Brian, we can't work our name around your respiratory illnesses.

137
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:54,083
Even without an inhaler, "Follow Them to the Edge of the Dessert" is too long.

138
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,416
Yeah, but when we get famous, our fans will shorten it to FTTTEOTD.

139
00:06:58,523 --> 00:07:00,084
Do you guys have any suggestions?

140
00:07:00,305 --> 00:07:01,759
Oh, we wouldn't dare.

141
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,596
Hey Lane, how are you gonna play a party like this with your mom being so strict?

142
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,822
Easy. Rory and Jess are gonna deliver my drums to Kyle's house for me,

143
00:07:07,903 --> 00:07:10,208
then my friend Young Chui is going to pick me up to take me

144
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,517
to a fictional Seventh Day Adventist bowling party

145
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,100
that will conveniently last the length of our gig.

146
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:15,262
Nice going.

147
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,797
I've got my own ball and shoes.

148
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:18,467
Dude, don't tell people that.

149
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,130
- See you guys. 
- Yeah, see ya.

150
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,332
Bye.

151
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:24,591
- How about "The We"? 
- We?

152
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:26,127
Yeah. We are "The We."

153
00:07:27,408 --> 00:07:28,692
I can't talk about this anymore.

154
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,381
- So, any word on your car? 
- Nothing.

155
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:34,386
You'd think someone would've found it. It was pretty one of a kind.

156
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,143
It's probably holed up in some chop shop.

157
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:38,427
Say goodbye, it's gone.

158
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:40,335
Whatever. Let's talk about something else.

159
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,444
I like that you're getting to know Dave a little.

160
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:43,602
Yeah, he's a cool guy.

161
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,859
Good. It's going to make the four of us going to prom together even more fun.

162
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:48,385
Ah, yes, I almost forgot about the prom.

163
00:07:48,486 --> 00:07:50,055
No, you were trying to forget about the prom.

164
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:52,199
I agreed to go and I am a man of my word.

165
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,832
- How's that arm I twisted? 
- I got the feeling back in it.

166
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:57,990
It's just if there was one more dance I wanna go to in my whole life,

167
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,857
it'd be the Stars Hollow High prom, with Lane. That's a big part of it.

168
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,106
I'm getting the tickets this week.

169
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,787
- And I'll pay, okay? 
- Not a chance.

170
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,980
It means a tux, you know. I know it's geeky.

171
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:10,120
Tuxes are also James Bond. That's not geeky.

172
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:11,094
You're kind.

173
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:13,270
And going to stash a change of clothes in the limo.

174
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:21,022
- Sookie. 
- Yeah?

175
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:25,323
I need love and a hug. I just had to lay off Julio.

176
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:26,787
Oh, poor thing.

177
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,546
That's the third one today. All I'm doing is crushing people's spirits.

178
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:32,072
But you told them that we all love them

179
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:34,387
and will hire them back as soon as all the repairs are done.

180
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:35,927
And I gave them their severance checks

181
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,883
and they were all very gracious, which made it that much harder.

182
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:40,319
We're gonna get 'em back. It'll all be good again.

183
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:43,224
I had to lay off Frank, too, but I just couldn't do another one,

184
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:45,134
so Michel offered to do it.

185
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:46,352
Did he say he'd be nice?

186
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,395
Yes, and then he skipped off to do it.

187
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,307
Oh, boy.

188
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:51,006
So, what's going on with Luke here?

189
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,181
I don't know. I've been keeping my distance because of what happened.

190
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,047
What happened?

191
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:58,836
Well, he was lying on the floor pretty much like that,

192
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:02,234
tinkering with stuff back there, and I got down

193
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:06,009
and leaned in to see what he was doing, and after a while,

194
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:09,531
I realized that the whole time, my hand was on his butt.

195
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:11,083
- Sookie! 
- It was an accident.

196
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:13,325
It's getting very Cinemax at night in here.

197
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:14,509
It was embarrassing.

198
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:17,320
So, how was it?

199
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:18,548
- His butt? 
- Yeah.

200
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:19,757
It's got a nice shape to it.

201
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,132
Will you two stop talking about my butt?

202
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,277
- It's all positive. 
- And in bad taste.

203
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,942
We'll just talk about it after you leave.

204
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:27,380
Which is now, because I'm done.

205
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,793
So what's the prognosis?

206
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,551
It's the same as what the stove company told you.

207
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,363
The wall back here is burned from the fire.

208
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:33,735
You're gonna have to rebuild the whole thing

209
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,281
before you can even think of reconnecting the gas.

210
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,828
It's gonna take awhile, sorry.

211
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:41,653
No, Luke, thanks for doing this. It's exactly what the contractor said.

212
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:43,788
We just wanted a guy with a good butt's opinion.

213
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:45,862
Yeah, Tom has a terrible butt.

214
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:46,785
Please stop that.

215
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:48,243
So Rory and I will see you Saturday for breakfast?

216
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,310
Actually, you won't. Nicole and I are going skiing

217
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:52,569
and we're getting a ridiculously early start.

218
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,414
That sounds fun. Why ridiculously early?

219
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:56,609
Because she has to drive in from her place in New York first

220
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:58,805
because she can't stay at my place because of Jess.

221
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,392
Hey, if you want, why don't you have her come in Friday night,

222
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:04,290
you guys can stay here at the inn. It'll be on the house.

223
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:05,371
Nah, that's okay.

224
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:08,458
No, do it, Luke. I mean, I know we have rooms available,

225
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:12,190
and it's my way of saying thanks for parading that nice butt around here.

226
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:14,669
- Geez. 
- No kidding, really, it's a great butt.

227
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:15,498
Stop it.

228
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:17,551
No, really, it's no problem.

229
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:21,090
Well, I don't know, maybe. Either way, thank for the offer.

230
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,968
All right. I'll tell Michel to keep a room available

231
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,791
- in case you decide to do it. 
- Okay. See ya.

232
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:25,683
Thanks, bye.

233
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,568
Did you know that Frank rescues Chow puppies?

234
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:31,822
No.

235
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:35,110
He feeds and houses them on his own dime 'til he finds an owner.

236
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:37,874
We can't fire him. And they are so cute.

237
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,852
Chin-Chin and Pau-Pau. Pau-Pau's the one with the squatty little nose.

238
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:43,286
I took them both.

239
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:45,924
Oh, okay, good job.

240
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:49,047
I have to go buy dog food. Will you fire Frank for me?

241
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:49,763
Sure thing.

242
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:01,993
With that last function, we raised just enough to put us in the black,

243
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:03,887
which got the school controller off our back,

244
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:06,384
which is going to make our last endeavor that much easier.

245
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,572
Haven't we already talked all this stuff to death?

246
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,217
Yes, but we need to fill in our last minute Booster Club add-ons here.

247
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,840
- You get the scary threatening letter? 
- Yup.

248
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:17,824
So, onto Grad Night, our last event of the year.

249
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:19,279
God, this year's gone by fast.

250
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:21,346
I can't believe my Farrah's eighteen.

251
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:23,497
My kid was eighteen was she was ten.

252
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:24,885
- Men. 
- What?

253
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:26,959
Lay low, Doug. They're setting traps.

254
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:28,381
So, what are we doing this year?

255
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:30,635
- We're throwing a big party on a yacht. 
- Fun.

256
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:33,447
The party starts while it's in dock, then it sails for three hours

257
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,200
- and concludes with a fireworks show. 
- How's the fundraising going?

258
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:39,755
Terrific. The last fashion show alone brought in half of what we need,

259
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,540
and the bake sale today brought in way more than I expected.

260
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,127
Oh, that reminds me.

261
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,908
- What's this? 
- Our cash box.

262
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:49,263
- You are the Grad Night treasurer. 
- I'm the what?

263
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:51,425
Before you got here, we took a little vote and you won.

264
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:54,341
Well, maybe there should be a recount 'cause I stink with money.

265
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,370
- The vote was unanimous. 
- I was late, can we revote?

266
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,755
Doug was late, too, and he was voted lead chaperone.

267
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:00,512
Goody.

268
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:01,659
Come on, we can take 'em.

269
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,301
It's really not a tough job, Lorelai. You just manage the cash,

270
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:05,817
keep the simple books, it's easy.

271
00:12:05,946 --> 00:12:08,095
Although, it does mean if you don't show up at our next meeting,

272
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,190
we're going to assume you ran off with our money.

273
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:12,454
No, no, I wouldn't do that.

274
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:16,068
Hello, ladies. Hope I'm not too late. Oh, and gentleman, sorry.

275
00:12:16,417 --> 00:12:18,136
Oh, Doug's one of the ladies now.

276
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:21,157
Well, good to see you all. Terry, Carrie. Lorelai, good to see you.

277
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:23,533
- Yeah, good, same here. 
- So, what'd I miss?

278
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:26,529
Nothing much. Lorelai's been made our Grad Night treasurer.

279
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:27,502
You up to the challenge?

280
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,459
Oh, yeah. I'll watch the little box here.

281
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:32,448
And let me guess, other than that, they've been picking on you mercilessly.

282
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:33,293
Pretty much.

283
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,368
Well, I'm here to lend you gender support, my friend.

284
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:37,124
So, Terry, why don't you continue?

285
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:39,259
Great. We were discussing Grad Night.

286
00:12:39,397 --> 00:12:40,882
The yacht. Sounds great.

287
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,638
Now, we've already spoken to six caterers,

288
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,584
they're all excited to bid on the project,

289
00:12:44,732 --> 00:12:46,837
but a couple are so expensive that

290
00:12:47,072 --> 00:12:49,058
I know they'll price themselves out of the running.

291
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,374
Weird. Very weird.

292
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,048
It's as if we had no history.

293
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,511
He treated me the same as he treated what's her name

294
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:58,486
and the overly coifed lady and the one who kept jiggling her leg the whole time.

295
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,272
- I hate that. 
- It's like an earthquake.

296
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:03,500
- And he was so nonchalant. 
- So, standoff-y?

297
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,393
No, he was just Max.

298
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:08,886
And I wanted to hook up with after to talk,

299
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:10,221
but very conveniently,

300
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,775
he excused himself five minutes early for an appointment

301
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:15,895
and I couldn't walk out early with him

302
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:17,703
because I'm the stupid treasurer and it would look fishy.

303
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:19,899
They made you treasurer. Are they insane?

304
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:22,244
I tried to tell them. And what's with this appointment nonsense?

305
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,102
And no eye contact.

306
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:25,793
You mean he never once looked at you?

307
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:29,146
Oh, he looked, but it was very lacking in meaning.

308
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,123
Were you looking at him meaningfully?

309
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:32,629
No. I was trying to play it cool.

310
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:35,255
There you go. He was doing the same thing.

311
00:13:35,343 --> 00:13:38,009
You were both James Dean-ing it, trying to keep it professional.

312
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,605
No, he was not playing at it, I was.

313
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,269
- He was really it. 
- What?

314
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:43,862
- Cool. 
- Got it.

315
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:44,804
So...

316
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,150
Maybe you two never kissed.

317
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:49,077
Me and Max? Oh no, we kissed.

318
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:50,433
Maybe it was an illusion.

319
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,096
It was not an illusion, Doug Henning. We kissed.

320
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:55,087
Don't be so sure because something like this happened to me

321
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:57,505
when I was like ten. I was so into Leif Garrett

322
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:00,996
and I fantasized about kissing him so much that at some point,

323
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,613
- I really thought it happened. 
- I kissed Max, Sookie.

324
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:05,697
I can still feel Leif's lips on mine.

325
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:06,526
I kissed him.

326
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:08,154
What is Rory's take on all this?

327
00:14:08,257 --> 00:14:11,043
Oh, I told her about the kiss at first, but it's weird.

328
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:12,757
I mean, he's back at Chilton and I'm back

329
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,647
having some sort of involvement with her teacher.

330
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,117
She's dealing with finals and everything.

331
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:17,535
I don't wanna stress her out about this.

332
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,557
Lorelai, what's the ultimate thing here?

333
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,293
Do you wanna get back together with him?

334
00:14:21,498 --> 00:14:23,710
I don't know. I don't know what I'm feeling

335
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,029
or what I'm looking for these days, and I hate that.

336
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:28,487
'Cause it's so wishy-washy, but it's true.

337
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,618
I mean, technically, I'm still seeing Alex,

338
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,598
although it's more intermittent than ever.

339
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,300
I'm not even sure I wanna get back together with Max.

340
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:36,096
The kiss just happened out of the blue.

341
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:37,341
The alleged kiss.

342
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:40,141
- Sookie, we kissed. 
- Okay, calm down.

343
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:43,797
If I knew where Max was on all this, I would know better where I was.

344
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,024
It's like when you go to a steak and lobster place,

345
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,927
it's easier to know what you want once you know what your date wants.

346
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,604
Like, you want steak if he's getting lobster,

347
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:53,250
'cause then you can share. Or if he's not,

348
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:55,984
you can get surf and turf, though you risk looking like a pig,

349
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:57,719
but some guys aren't turned on by a big appetite,

350
00:14:57,781 --> 00:14:59,420
and now I'm not just confused, I'm massively hungry.

351
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:02,129
Me, too. Maybe lunch will take your mind off it a bit.

352
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:02,931
Hope so.

353
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,406
Are you sure there was really an Alex?

354
00:15:04,493 --> 00:15:05,169
Stop.

355
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:09,301
Come in.

356
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,899
Well, well. Jess Mariano.

357
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:16,367
What a pleasure. Sit down.

358
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:19,210
I was just trying to buy prom tickets and they told me to go see you.

359
00:15:19,747 --> 00:15:20,397
Sit down.

360
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,913
So, the prom, huh?

361
00:15:25,277 --> 00:15:27,622
I wouldn't have taken you for someone who'd wanna go to the prom.

362
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:28,891
My girlfriend wants to.

363
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:30,991
- Oh, that's too bad. 
- What, why?

364
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:33,187
- Because you flunked out. 
- I what?

365
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,257
You're not graduating, Jess.

366
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:37,719
Prom tickets are for graduating seniors only.

367
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:38,937
Guess your girlfriend's outta luck.

368
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,103
Now wait a minute. I'm just a little behind.

369
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,414
I can catch up, no sweat.

370
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:44,150
You can't, you missed too much.

371
00:15:44,258 --> 00:15:45,323
It hasn't been that much.

372
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,031
Thirty-one days you've been out. Cutoff's twenty.

373
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,131
- So that's it, just like that? 
- That's it.

374
00:15:50,274 --> 00:15:51,334
Thanks for the warning.

375
00:15:51,446 --> 00:15:54,032
You mean the nine warning slips we gave you weren't enough?

376
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:56,802
All the meetings that I tried to set up between you and your guidance counselor,

377
00:15:56,844 --> 00:16:00,140
between you and me that you blew off, that wasn't warning enough?

378
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:03,306
I can catch up, I'm smarter than anyone here.

379
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,629
- And humble, too. 
- I can catch up, you'll see.

380
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:07,852
There's nothing to see, you're out.

381
00:16:07,944 --> 00:16:10,704
Fine, I'll take summer school if that's what you want.

382
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:12,363
Good, but it's not enough.

383
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,314
You have to take the whole year over.

384
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:15,557
The whole year? No way.

385
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,761
Then no diploma.

386
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,052
At least let me go to the prom, what's the big deal?

387
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,761
- We're done here. 
- Come on.

388
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:26,593
You wanna talk about coming back next year, my door's open.

389
00:16:30,478 --> 00:16:31,713
I'm not gonna miss this place.

390
00:16:32,086 --> 00:16:32,921
Vice versa.

391
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:37,308
- No, no, it's impossible. 
- What?

392
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:40,058
I just counted the money in the cash box and I'm eighteen dollars short.

393
00:16:40,202 --> 00:16:41,887
Weren't you supposed to deposit all that at the bank?

394
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,052
Be judgmental later. Help me in my fiscal crisis here.

395
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:46,699
Did you count the money when they gave it to you?

396
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:48,139
Ah, I glanced at it.

397
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,996
Boy, you are a sucky treasurer.

398
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,247
The job was forced on me.

399
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:53,110
The cash box must've been short when you got it.

400
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,507
Or maybe a burglar broke in here. That could've happened.

401
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:57,775
A burglar who bypassed out TV, our stereo,

402
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:00,279
and our jewelry and went straight for the Booster Club cash box

403
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:01,609
and took eighteen dollars and left the rest?

404
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:04,349
- Some burglars are less greedy than others. 
- I'm out of answers.

405
00:17:04,436 --> 00:17:06,904
Great. I'm gonna have to put eighteen of my own dollars

406
00:17:06,956 --> 00:17:09,665
in to ward off suspicion. You're off to the party this early?

407
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:12,009
Jess and I are helping the band set up. I do the cymbals.

408
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,372
- You're not taking your purse. 
- I'm not?

409
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:14,942
You don't need money, you don't need ID.

410
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:16,581
Where will I keep my house key?

411
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:21,190
You'll put your house key through the metal thingy on your belt.

412
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:23,750
You'll only lose it if you take off your belt,

413
00:17:23,857 --> 00:17:26,910
and if you're taking off your belt for any reason at the party,

414
00:17:27,053 --> 00:17:28,578
I'm not sure I want you coming home.

415
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:29,588
Brilliant.

416
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:32,092
Your shoes okay? You got good traction?

417
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:32,940
Traction?

418
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:35,675
Well, there'll be liquids of various textures and disgustingness.

419
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:37,309
- You eating there? 
- Oh, if they have stuff.

420
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,045
Do not eat chips out of a communal bowl.

421
00:17:39,122 --> 00:17:40,606
You might as well stick your hand in a toilet.

422
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:41,241
Nice.

423
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:42,542
If you're desperate, offer to be the person

424
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:46,054
who replenishes them with new bags and grab a handful out of the new bag

425
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:47,657
and dump the rest in the communal bowl.

426
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,390
Got it.

427
00:17:48,455 --> 00:17:49,915
And keep in mind that getting up on a table

428
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:52,875
and performing a song of any kind will haunt you for the rest of your life.

429
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,212
Trust me. Been there, done that.

430
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:55,356
I wasn't planning on doing that.

431
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,725
Those things are never planned.

432
00:17:56,873 --> 00:17:57,643
- You going now? 
- Yup.

433
00:17:57,807 --> 00:17:58,723
I'm going, too.

434
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,423
I'll lock it up.

435
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,984
Otherwise I'd have to undo my belt.

436
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,310
Enjoy your Booster Club meeting.

437
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:04,923
- I will. Hey, hon? 
- Yeah?

438
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,165
I promised myself I wasn't gonna ask you about Max anymore

439
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:10,265
considering the history and that he's back teaching you and all...

440
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:15,528
and I'm gonna keep my promise. Good, huh?

441
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,265
Very good.

442
00:18:16,425 --> 00:18:18,017
Okay, well, that's all I wanted to say.

443
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:18,893
Okay.

444
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:28,877
Does this set up feel right to everybody?

445
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,340
- Cool by me. 
- Me, too.

446
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:31,564
How's it look out there?

447
00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:34,669
Like you're gonna bullet straight to the top of the charts,

448
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:37,550
with a bullet or a - a gun's gonna shoot a bullet,

449
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,094
and I'm not familiar with the precise terminology, but it's working, right?

450
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,987
- They look like a band to me. 
- You need to move back more.

451
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:44,642
Why?

452
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,727
Because when I do my double jump kick off the amp

453
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,548
with slashing windmills, I'm gonna need more room.

454
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:49,503
Well, don't do that then.

455
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,467
Yeah, sounds a little too Milli Vanilli, Zach.

456
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:53,076
And if I back up anymore, my extension cord

457
00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:54,570
might damage the miniature date palm.

458
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:56,333
- The what? 
- It's what that's called. My aunt's got one.

459
00:18:56,444 --> 00:19:00,094
Dude, don't call plants by their specific names, it's very not rock and roll.

460
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:01,703
Let's finalize the set list, guys.

461
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:06,640
Need any help hiding the valuables, Kyle?

462
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:09,455
Nope. We stashed the snow globes, hid the Lladros,

463
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,798
now we're just packing up the Hummels.

464
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:11,657
Two to go.

465
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,071
Marshall, watch it!

466
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:15,472
Boy with Toothache is mom's favorite.

467
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:16,387
Sorry.

468
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:20,136
Hey, did I hear the singer say something about a double jump kick?

469
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:21,968
- We'll talk him out of it. 
- Good.

470
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,646
Zealous Xylophonist, that's sweet.

471
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:26,788
Starting off with a slow tune won't work, Brian.

472
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,923
Yeah, man, it's so emo, it makes me sick.

473
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:30,637
I was just playing devil's advocate.

474
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:33,632
- Devil's advocate. 
- Not a bad name.

475
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,750
Keg!

476
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:37,838
That's my cousin Rick.

477
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,972
He just turned twenty-one. Pretty awesome.

478
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:42,067
Twenty-one, yeah!

479
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:43,418
What is that, beer?

480
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:45,742
- No, it's one of those milk kegs. 
- Good one.

481
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,008
There's beer, is that legal?

482
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:48,825
Well, apparently Rick is twenty-one.

483
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,879
Twenty-one, woo-hoo!

484
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:53,643
- Or just really into that particular integer. 
- Beer.

485
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,771
It's a party, Lane. What were you expecting, Tang?

486
00:19:57,207 --> 00:20:00,222
- No, I guess not. 
- The carpet, guys. Lift it, lift it.

487
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:01,370
Oh, we got it.

488
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,254
Marshall, go get towels to set it on.

489
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,083
And not the good towels, the swim towels.

490
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,365
Anything I can help you with, guys?

491
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:09,906
We got it covered. Thanks, Young Chui.

492
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:12,209
How about you, Lane? You need water or anything?

493
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,314
Young Chui, you should probably stay away from the band area.

494
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,686
We got a lot of cords and stuff,

495
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,883
and I don't want you to get electrocuted and die.

496
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:19,547
Oh, okay.

497
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,244
So, is he staying for the whole thing?

498
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:25,037
He's got nowhere else to go.

499
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,888
These are the good towels.

500
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:29,271
These are the swim towels.

501
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:31,744
The swim towels have stripes and they're oversized.

502
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:32,784
Now, come on, hurry.

503
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:35,348
We still have to put away my dad's military icon collector plates.

504
00:20:36,962 --> 00:20:38,366
We're here a little early, don't you think?

505
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:40,091
No, we're with the band. We're the roadies

506
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,266
and the sound crew and I'm advising on makeup for Lane

507
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:44,714
and I'm the keeper of Brian's sandwich and thermos.

508
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,439
So we're busy backstage-type people.

509
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:47,581
We're dork-early.

510
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:51,871
Come on, get into the spirit of things. Hello Cleveland!

511
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:54,611
Guess I'll wander around a little.

512
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:03,593
And you couldn't even work your slashing windmills in.

513
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,217
- Yeah, maybe I'll skip it. 
- Good thinking.

514
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:11,237
Michel, are you okay?

515
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:12,871
Do I look okay?

516
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,882
Are those people waiting for a bellman?

517
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:18,135
No, they're waiting for a unicorn to sing to a rainbow. Yes, a bellman.

518
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,203
But there's only one because we had to lay off the others.

519
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:23,290
And a maid called in sick, so not only am I dealing with answering phones

520
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:24,447
and checking people in and out,

521
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:27,207
but I'm going to have to do turn down service and carry people's bags

522
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,292
- to their rooms and... 
- You're going to a bad place.

523
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,961
Now just take a breath and go to a good place.

524
00:21:31,078 --> 00:21:33,040
Plus, I had to run home and play with my Chow puppies

525
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:35,605
because the Chow book said they need love and stimulation

526
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:37,892
or else they'll murder you later on.

527
00:21:37,954 --> 00:21:40,109
And Pau-Pau had fallen in her water bowl

528
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:42,972
and was soaking wet so I had to blow dry her and...

529
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,625
Okay, the nice place, and I can stay and help a little bit, okay?

530
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,437
She could've drowned. I'm a bad daddy.

531
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:49,778
Pau-Pau's fine. Just watch the desk,

532
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:51,529
get the bellman back here. I'll do turn down.

533
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:54,668
Have you ever seen Chow puppies?

534
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:56,363
You want to eat them up.

535
00:21:56,587 --> 00:22:00,443
They're getting ready to go on. They're all hyperventilating to the same rhythm,

536
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,563
so that's a positive sign. What are you looking at?

537
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:04,738
The happy family. Kinda depressing if you ask me.

538
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,002
Oh, Mr. Sunshine. You're spreading so much joy around,

539
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:08,313
you're embarrassing yourself.

540
00:22:09,951 --> 00:22:11,089
You've got to get a little more moody.

541
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,303
I'll try.

542
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:14,160
Let's look around a little bit.

543
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:15,174
Okay.

544
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:19,916
- Seems a little early for that. 
- It never is.

545
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,369
- Bathroom line. 
- Figures.

546
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:30,005
- Hey. What's up with you guys? 
- Stupid keg.

547
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:31,680
- It's not working. 
- Where's the tap?

548
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:33,758
- The what? 
- It's a keg, it's sealed.

549
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:36,046
You need to hook up a tap to pump the beer out.

550
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:37,864
I told you the thing in the bag did something.

551
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:41,939
- No instructions. 
- Jeez.

552
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:48,785
There, start pumping.

553
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:51,059
All right. To Jess!

554
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,164
- To Jess. 
- To Jess.

555
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:55,878
You and Springsteen, the working man's hero.

556
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:59,440
- You ready to go on, guys? 
- Only if Brian rallies.

557
00:22:59,512 --> 00:22:59,943
What's wrong, Brian?

558
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,365
- I don't feel good. 
- It's his heartburn again.

559
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,448
I told you, dude, it's your citrus intake.

560
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,760
Stop eating oranges.

561
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:12,468
Rory.

562
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,680
- You've gotta do me a big favor. 
- Name it.

563
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:17,228
Young Chui's driving me crazy.

564
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:20,224
What do you want me to do?

565
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:24,817
If you see any unattached girls who you think would go for a very available,

566
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:27,291
needy, self-delusional guy, send 'em Young Chui's way.

567
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:28,130
I'll keep a lookout.

568
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,164
Lane.

569
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:31,309
- Oh my God, this is it. 
- Knock 'em dead.

570
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:33,579
Brian, you with us?

571
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:35,576
I have completely forgotten how to play the bass.

572
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:37,356
- Perfect. 
- Brian, you're just nervous.

573
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:39,006
Take a deep breath and use your inhaler.

574
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,878
Yeah, and don't forget that the hair and fingernails on John Entwistle's body

575
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,639
were still growing when they brought in his replacement.

576
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,528
- You're gonna replace me? 
- We're not gonna replace you.

577
00:23:45,586 --> 00:23:47,080
Just relax and let the music flow through you.

578
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:48,447
Come on, let's go!

579
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:50,818
Yeah, come on - rock and roll!

580
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:53,849
- Zach, start. 
- Wait, wait, someone's gotta introduce us.

581
00:23:54,238 --> 00:23:56,845
- Rory, introduce us. 
- Me? Why me?

582
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:59,809
- Come on, let's go! 
- Yeah, crank it!

583
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,474
- Go, go. 
- All right.

584
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:05,083
Now, who wants to hear some tunes?

585
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:08,826
Okay, good, there's a consensus.

586
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:11,550
Here they are, Stars Hollow's rockingest band.

587
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:13,558
Although they're not all from Stars Hollow,

588
00:24:13,644 --> 00:24:15,806
but they practice there,

589
00:24:15,882 --> 00:24:17,475
so we kind of consider them our own.

590
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:18,667
Here they are...

591
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,999
What's your name?

592
00:24:20,178 --> 00:24:21,561
"Follow them to the Edge of the Dessert."

593
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:22,907
"The Chops." "Follow them to the Edge of the Dessert."

594
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:23,671
"The Chops."

595
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:40,079
- Yeah? 
- Turn down.

596
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:40,889
Come on in.

597
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:44,254
Hello there. This won't take long.

598
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:47,285
- Luke. 
- Lorelai.

599
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:48,595
What are you doing here?

600
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,485
- You invited us, remember? 
- Us?

601
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,439
Oh, hey. Hi Nicole. There's the "us".

602
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,489
Hi, Lorelai.

603
00:24:54,607 --> 00:24:56,824
I don't usually do this turn down service.

604
00:24:56,906 --> 00:24:58,893
I mean, I did when I started many moons ago,

605
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,941
but that's when I was a maid.

606
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:03,019
- Wow, you guys are here. 
- You didn't know?

607
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,361
No. I mean, I remember inviting you.

608
00:25:04,428 --> 00:25:05,205
It's great that you're here.

609
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,601
But when I told Michel I would do the turn down service,

610
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:10,736
it must've slipped his mind that you were here.

611
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:12,902
- Pau-Pau fell in her water dish. 
- What?

612
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:15,585
Never mind. I'll just do this and get out of your way.

613
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,717
Hey, you don't have to.

614
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:18,324
Yeah, Lorelai, really, we can do all this.

615
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:21,929
No, you are our guests and you deserve to get what you're paying for.

616
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,367
We're not paying.

617
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:26,593
No, no, but this is where you start paying - in sweat.

618
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:28,083
- What? 
- Fame, right?

619
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:29,655
Yeah, Debbie Allen. In sweat.

620
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,402
I just loved how she said that.

621
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:35,216
- Let's see... you need towels. 
- You can just give 'em to me.

622
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,336
Okay, here are your towels.

623
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:42,189
And, let me see... oh, I'll draw your curtains closed.

624
00:25:44,004 --> 00:25:45,800
What else, what else?

625
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,942
It's been a little while since I've done this.

626
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:49,690
Oh, do you want a fire?

627
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:51,816
- I don't know. Nicole? 
- A fire would be nice.

628
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:53,413
Okay, I'll light it for you.

629
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:57,520
We have these new log bags now, makes it real easy.

630
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,852
So, nothing like a fire on a cold night like this, huh?

631
00:26:11,826 --> 00:26:13,174
I'm not having much luck here.

632
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,502
And, you know what,

633
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:20,024
we laid off the person who was able to light these things no problem,

634
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,880
now we can't light these things, and ironically we laid him off because of a fire.

635
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:24,919
It's okay, forget it. I can light it.

636
00:26:25,072 --> 00:26:25,733
Okay.

637
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:27,940
What else, let's see. Oh...

638
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,534
Turn down. I need to turn down the bed.

639
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:34,406
- Really, Lorelai. 
- No, no, no. Up, up, up.

640
00:26:35,737 --> 00:26:39,993
Okay, I'll get ya all settled here, nice and comfy.

641
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:43,184
Great lines with these covers here.

642
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,395
Pillows, nice and plump.

643
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,177
And a couple of pillow mints.

644
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,645
There you go, now you're all ready to...

645
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:50,990
you're all ready for your evening.

646
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,455
Fine, good, that's good.

647
00:26:52,636 --> 00:26:53,762
Yes, great, Lorelai.

648
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:57,270
You're all set. Just call if you need anything, and have fun.

649
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:18,035
Okay, thanks. We're gonna take a short break and then we'll be back.

650
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,475
Guys, that was amazing. Really, it was awesome.

651
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:22,171
Thanks.

652
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:23,707
Dude, you did good, you really did.

653
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:26,252
But you got a little too close to me when you were singing into the mike.

654
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:27,830
I got as close as I had to.

655
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:30,471
Your nose touched my cheek, man. That's too close.

656
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,612
Guys, come on, just be happy.

657
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:35,853
We played and we didn't suck, right?

658
00:27:36,314 --> 00:27:37,138
Yeah, it was good.

659
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:39,351
Come on, let's spread the word.

660
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:41,290
All drinks on coasters, please.

661
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:43,131
Hey, the coasters are there to be used, guys.

662
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:46,001
Dave, what's wrong?

663
00:27:46,176 --> 00:27:47,916
- I mean, we totally rocked. 
- We sounded great.

664
00:27:48,106 --> 00:27:48,936
Then what is it?

665
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:50,993
It's this Young Chui thing. It's driving me crazy.

666
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,166
- Why? 
- Why?

667
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:53,338
Lane, when are you...

668
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,372
when are you gonna break up with him?

669
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,522
It's complicated. Young Chui's very sensitive right now.

670
00:27:57,697 --> 00:27:59,192
I'm sorry, but I don't care.

671
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,604
If you got to know him, you'd understand.

672
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:02,454
I don't want to get to know him. I just want him to do his part

673
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:04,573
and break up with you so that I can take you to your prom.

674
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:06,318
He's acting like he's in love with you or something.

675
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:08,105
- Well... 
- Oh, no. Is he?

676
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:09,786
- Kind of. 
- Kind of?

677
00:28:09,918 --> 00:28:10,804
Apparently, totally.

678
00:28:10,968 --> 00:28:13,897
Young Chui is in love with you and that's why he won't break up with you,

679
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:15,677
so that he gets to take you to your prom.

680
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:18,204
And he knows that your mom likes him and that we're running out of time.

681
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,220
- No, we're not out of time. 
- The prom's in two weeks.

682
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:21,342
I'll make it happen, I swear.

683
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:22,238
It's too late.

684
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:24,844
I'll see you for the next set.

685
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:26,038
Dave.

686
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,454
So, what now?

687
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:29,891
What do you mean, what now?

688
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,367
- Let's go, let's get out of here. 
- Go where?

689
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:32,407
- Anywhere. 
- It's early.

690
00:28:32,508 --> 00:28:33,160
It's boring.

691
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:34,834
Jess, we can't just go.

692
00:28:34,982 --> 00:28:35,730
Yes, we can.

693
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,194
The band's playing a whole other set.

694
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:38,362
They can do it without us.

695
00:28:38,495 --> 00:28:42,273
I don't wanna leave. Now, come on, try to have fun. Talk, mingle.

696
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:45,244
I don't wanna talk to anybody else. I don't like anybody else.

697
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,365
I don't wanna leave.

698
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,754
I need to stay here for Lane, come on.

699
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,790
Gloomy.

700
00:28:53,917 --> 00:28:55,310
We'll go right when they get done playing, okay?

701
00:28:55,474 --> 00:28:57,010
- Sure, Grandpa. 
- Rory.

702
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:58,679
We'll go then, I promise.

703
00:28:59,524 --> 00:29:02,746
Hey, you drop a chip, you pick it up.

704
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,696
It's common courtesy folks.

705
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:20,085
So, Lindsay, what did you think of Lane's band?

706
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:23,228
I liked 'em. Although I didn't recognize most of the songs.

707
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:25,195
She's not a music freak like you.

708
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,300
- Well, we all can't be freaks. 
- True.

709
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:28,954
So what kind of music do you like?

710
00:29:29,097 --> 00:29:31,775
I don't know... Michelle Branch, Matchbox 20.

711
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:32,615
Jeez.

712
00:29:34,002 --> 00:29:36,681
I like them, too. I mean, I like all kinds of things.

713
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:37,873
You used to go to our school.

714
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,071
He still goes.

715
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,360
Really? I haven't seen you around much.

716
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,927
What are you, the attendance monitor?

717
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:46,132
I'm gonna go see what the hell's holding up this line.

718
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:49,583
- He's not feeling well. 
- That's too bad.

719
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,175
We'll see you later.

720
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:52,502
- Bye. 
- Bye.

721
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:57,729
Hey, Lane.

722
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:59,927
- There's some guy looking for you. 
- Good, where?

723
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,719
Oh, oh, and the part where Gimli the Dwarf is riding his horse,

724
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,021
then Legolas grabs the front straps and swings himself up on top of it.

725
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:13,654
Dude, dude, that was awesome!

726
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,427
- Any more left in that thing? 
- Plenty. Foam or no foam?

727
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:19,240
Anything you hand me, Kyle, I'm downing.

728
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:26,102
- Very refreshing. 
- Oh, oh, and at the end

729
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,757
when the tree is on fire and then he puts himself out in the flood. Oh!

730
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,280
Hi, sorry I'm late.

731
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:35,522
Actually, I'm not late. I was right on time,

732
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:38,498
but then I remembered I left the cash box in the car.

733
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:41,365
I mean, I was not used to having to carry a cash box.

734
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:42,881
So I went back and got it,

735
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:44,852
and I was carrying it by the handle

736
00:30:45,005 --> 00:30:47,582
and the stupid thing flew open and money flew everywhere,

737
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:50,177
and I may have lost eighteen bucks in the process.

738
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:52,271
Anyway, here I am.

739
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,318
So where's Doug?

740
00:30:55,631 --> 00:30:57,120
I believe we scared Doug away.

741
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:58,703
I love scaring the Dougs away.

742
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:01,760
So, you were telling us about these ridiculous dock fees.

743
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,956
Right. We got what was supposed to be a final quote

744
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,737
from the yacht owner, who then remembers he failed to mention

745
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:08,887
- an exorbitant dock fee. 
- Unbelievable.

746
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,721
And I don't wanna pay. I made some calls

747
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:12,809
and I have several suggestions on how to get around it.

748
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:16,382
Oh, but first, let me bring in a student from the senior class

749
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:18,719
who wanted to give her own thoughts about the yacht trip.

750
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:20,069
Come on in.

751
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:23,839
- Oh no. 
- Paris Gellar.

752
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,394
Ladies, thank you for seeing me.

753
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,637
I know you're busy with work and have families to get home to,

754
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:31,546
so I really appreciate your courtesy, and I'll make it brief.

755
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,936
Having Grad Night on a yacht is the worst idea

756
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:36,015
since Neville Chamberlain told the people of England,

757
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,442
"Hey, don't worry about Hitler. He's a stand-up chap."

758
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:42,125
Forget the inconvenience of being at sea with guests unable to leave

759
00:31:42,212 --> 00:31:45,443
if the party is dull or if the band, which will inevitably be composed

760
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:48,311
of accountants with semi-mullets, decides to do a half-hour tribute

761
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:50,743
to Kenny G. The seasickness factor alone,

762
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,232
abetted by snuck-in flasks and badly cooked food,

763
00:31:53,338 --> 00:31:56,742
could lead to an epidemic, which may lead to lawsuits the school could ill afford.

764
00:31:56,923 --> 00:32:00,194
These points conclusively call for a change in venue to a hotel ballroom,

765
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:02,621
a restaurant facility, several of which I've already called.

766
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,148
Here are the results of my research.

767
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:07,962
I've also included a list of maritime disasters from the past fifty years

768
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:10,337
-- capsizings, onboard fires, et cetera --

769
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:12,528
and trust me, it'll put you off your lunch.

770
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:14,495
Thank you for your time and cooperation.

771
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,697
So, my thought is to discuss these yacht fees

772
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,108
- directly with the yacht owner first. 
- Absolutely.

773
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,608
Hello everyone, sorry I'm late.

774
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:25,657
Oh, that's okay.

775
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:27,583
I'm Barbara Epstein, I teach drama,

776
00:32:27,726 --> 00:32:28,960
and I'll be your faculty rep tonight.

777
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:30,159
Welcome Barbara.

778
00:32:30,312 --> 00:32:32,954
I just left Max Medina, he filled me in on everything that you're doing here.

779
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,745
Good, then we'll get a running start.

780
00:32:35,064 --> 00:32:38,007
We're dealing with a fee that we do not wanna pay for this yacht.

781
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,507
Keep going, girls. I just need...

782
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,875
I'll be right back.

783
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:43,390
Joan, you gotta watch the cash box.

784
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:44,914
Will do.

785
00:32:50,574 --> 00:32:52,555
Oh, sorry. Nearest bathroom?

786
00:32:53,302 --> 00:32:56,273
That way, huh? I'm gonna go this way.

787
00:32:56,528 --> 00:32:59,017
I think the farthest one is the one I'm looking for.

788
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:02,467
I told a friend I'd meet her there, so I'll just go...

789
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:09,472
Gotcha.

790
00:33:10,512 --> 00:33:12,555
- You sure did. 
- Bad time?

791
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:13,476
Kind of.

792
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,920
- Busy? 
- Real busy.

793
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,070
- You're avoiding me. 
- No, I'm not.

794
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:23,608
Then what's with the 'I'm busy' thing?

795
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,660
I can't be busy?

796
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:26,579
Ah, but that's avoiding me, saying you're busy.

797
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:28,684
No, it's descriptive of my current state.

798
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,643
These essays are due back tomorrow, I'm way behind on my reading,

799
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:34,660
so I'm eating my day-old vending machine at my desk

800
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:36,528
in my futile attempt to try and catch up.

801
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,032
- Two rotations. 
- What?

802
00:33:39,196 --> 00:33:40,747
It's in the Booster Club bylaws, my friend.

803
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:44,102
I looked it up myself. Faculty advisors are supposed to do

804
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:46,262
a minimum of two consecutive rotations

805
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:47,925
with the Booster Club and you did only one.

806
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,539
- I did three. 
- What?

807
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:50,594
I did three.

808
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:51,966
You went to my third one.

809
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:54,776
I did the previous two you weren't at.

810
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:56,564
I'm assuming you have documentation?

811
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:57,915
Lorelai.

812
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:00,106
With Lorelai Gilmore, it's trust but verify.

813
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,843
I'm sure I can scrounge up a witness.

814
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:04,208
Why did you treat me so weird at that last meeting?

815
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,682
I treated you with respect and kindness.

816
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:07,859
That's why it was weird.

817
00:34:07,982 --> 00:34:10,425
It's how you treated Terry and Joan, too.

818
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,099
I mean, did you also kiss Terry and Joan?

819
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:14,107
Yeah, I did. And Doug.

820
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,438
- He was the best of the three. 
- Max.

821
00:34:15,612 --> 00:34:18,274
I was playing it cool. You were, too.

822
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:19,794
I was just following suit.

823
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:22,278
No, I was playing it cool because you were playing it cool.

824
00:34:22,385 --> 00:34:24,449
And I'm the treasurer and the treasurer has to be cool

825
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,722
- or it just looks suspicious. 
- Wait, wait, wait.

826
00:34:27,044 --> 00:34:29,103
- Ten feet. 
- Ten feet?

827
00:34:29,282 --> 00:34:30,982
That's a safe distance for us,

828
00:34:31,096 --> 00:34:32,984
and the more furniture in between, the better.

829
00:34:33,086 --> 00:34:34,362
I'm not gonna attack you.

830
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:36,563
I'm not worried about you, I'm worried about me.

831
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:39,835
I mean, there are people still walking the halls and this is my workplace

832
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:42,211
and I can't be held responsible for what I do around you.

833
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:44,859
I mean, you are like a mythological creature

834
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:47,347
that casts some kind of spell on me and makes me act stupid.

835
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:50,342
I'm not stupid. I don't act stupid with anyone else.

836
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,308
We're too close again.

837
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:55,124
I didn't bring a frickin' tape measure. I'm not good at judging distances.

838
00:34:55,324 --> 00:34:56,978
You'll have to help me out with the ten feet thing.

839
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,688
It's a little bigger than a basketball player.

840
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:01,387
Just keep a really big basketball player between us.

841
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:04,040
Wow, I bet there's a sentence that's never been uttered before.

842
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:09,953
There are other complications with this whole thing, you know.

843
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,347
Just thought I'd tell you.

844
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:12,580
What other complications?

845
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,848
I was seeing someone in California.

846
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:16,748
There, I said it.

847
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:18,976
You mean, you weren't living like a Trappist monk

848
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:20,321
while you were in California? I'm shocked.

849
00:35:20,455 --> 00:35:21,375
That doesn't bother you?

850
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,841
Max, we weren't together.

851
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:24,966
I mean, I have been seeing someone, too.

852
00:35:25,243 --> 00:35:28,877
I would probably still be seeing Diane if I hadn't moved back here.

853
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:31,781
That's something to think about.

854
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:33,527
So you can't date anyone for the rest of your life

855
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,508
because if you'd stayed in California, which you didn't,

856
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:37,685
- you might still be dating Diane? 
- Yes. No.

857
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:42,816
Do you want an aspirin? I probably have a... Tic Tac.

858
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:45,023
Sorry, I shouldn't have teased you with that aspirin thing.

859
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:49,384
You know, I thought we were both going to just pretend to ignore the kiss.

860
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:50,936
Wasn't that the deal?

861
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:52,800
We had a deal? I don't remember a deal.

862
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,440
You had your shot, okay?

863
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:58,289
You had the ring and you said no.

864
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:00,619
Yes, I did.

865
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,377
And you said that that was right for you, too.

866
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:06,496
You went to Stanford, you dated Diane, it was right for both of us.

867
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:08,221
What is this, now, right here?

868
00:36:08,411 --> 00:36:09,569
It's us.

869
00:36:11,054 --> 00:36:11,664
Tada.

870
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:13,429
Well, us needs to stay apart.

871
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,830
Oh Max, we had a whole country between us for a year.

872
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:20,971
That's like eleven-thousand basketball players lying end to end,

873
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:24,075
and yet, here we are. We can't avoid each other.

874
00:36:24,157 --> 00:36:26,558
I thought I was over you. I thought it was safe to come back here,

875
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,970
but no, not the deal. I just,

876
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,765
I think we should stay apart and never see each other ever again.

877
00:36:31,996 --> 00:36:34,340
- That's impossible. 
- No, it's not.

878
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:37,712
I'll be at the Chilton graduation and so will you.

879
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:39,227
I'll sit behind a tree.

880
00:36:39,348 --> 00:36:41,377
We could run into each other at a drugstore again.

881
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,429
I'm gonna order all my drugs online.

882
00:36:43,573 --> 00:36:46,866
If my car breaks down next to yours, will you stop?

883
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:49,370
I will stop, and keep my eyes straight forward,

884
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:53,625
call a garage and then stay in my car with the radio on really loud 'til they come,

885
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:55,003
and then I'm gone.

886
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:59,784
And I say we start being apart right now.

887
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:01,187
Okay.

888
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:03,475
Whatever you want.

889
00:37:04,146 --> 00:37:05,119
This is what I want.

890
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,505
And when I walk out that door,

891
00:37:09,196 --> 00:37:11,100
t could very well be the last time we see each other.

892
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,011
Okay.

893
00:37:13,995 --> 00:37:15,575
I'll abide by your wishes.

894
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:17,566
Goodbye, Lorelai.

895
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:20,241
Goodbye, Max.

896
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:34,444
- You said you were leaving. 
- My car is that way.

897
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:35,464
I have to go that way, too.

898
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:36,405
After you.

899
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:38,059
Two seconds, we've already run into each other.

900
00:37:38,182 --> 00:37:38,955
Doesn't count.

901
00:37:46,093 --> 00:37:48,295
Young Chui, have you seen Jess?

902
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,517
I think I saw him go upstairs. Have you seen Lane?

903
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:53,640
Not for awhile. She's probably with the band. Why don't you go see?

904
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:55,658
Oh, I don't wanna lose these seats.

905
00:37:56,323 --> 00:37:57,474
Right, right.

906
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:04,214
It's just me and Marshall, Mom, honest...

907
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:07,695
Okay, kiss Uncle Newtie for me. Bye.

908
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,672
Hey Kyle. Mind if I use your phone there?

909
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:13,772
As long as it's local.

910
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:15,187
Oh, it's local distance, yeah, don't worry.

911
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:22,903
Hello, Mama?

912
00:38:23,312 --> 00:38:24,536
Hi, how are you doing tonight?...

913
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,948
It's Lane. Yeah, Lane...

914
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,797
Nothing's wrong. In fact, I'm feeling pretty good right now.

915
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:33,239
Had a beer and a half, nice cold beer.

916
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,284
And I just thought I'd tell you,

917
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,868
I'm drumming in a band tonight at a party and we rocked.

918
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:42,647
We were The Clash and Rage Against the Machine and Nirvana combined.

919
00:38:43,502 --> 00:38:45,595
And I'm in love with Dave Rygalski.

920
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:46,661
He's my guy, not Young Chui.

921
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:48,346
Young Chui's a ship in the night, Mama.

922
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,254
Not even a ship, he's a little tugboat tooting along

923
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:53,020
and I'm not gonna go to the prom with him,

924
00:38:53,173 --> 00:38:55,043
I'm going with Dave,

925
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:58,289
because we rock together, Mama. The charade is over.

926
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:00,767
What are you doing?

927
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,667
What I should've done months ago, Davey.

928
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,873
That was not your mother. Tell me that wasn't your mother.

929
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,624
Oh, that was the mother. I am liberated, my friend.

930
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:10,920
- You're drunk. 
- No, I'm... Am I?

931
00:39:11,238 --> 00:39:13,388
We're going on in five minutes. Can you even play?

932
00:39:13,513 --> 00:39:15,447
Oh, I can hit the sticks on those brums.

933
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,588
Great, great, but what about the drums?

934
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:19,667
Dave.

935
00:39:30,783 --> 00:39:31,428
There you are.

936
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:33,636
I've been looking all over for you.

937
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:35,263
Just got tired of everything down there.

938
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,473
Are we allowed to be up here?

939
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:40,906
I mean, Kyle was kind of discouraging it.

940
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:42,763
When you have a party, you get what you get.

941
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:43,656
Yeah, I guess.

942
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,718
Sad boy, what's wrong?

943
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:49,539
You were looking forward to this party, what happened?

944
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:51,658
- Nothing. 
- Something did.

945
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:54,066
Come on, tell me.

946
00:39:58,391 --> 00:39:59,661
You're not tired of me, are you?

947
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,047
That's a pretty good answer.

948
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:39,989
Jess, wait...

949
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:42,780
Jess...

950
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:45,765
Wait...

951
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:51,985
Jess.

952
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:55,564
- Jeez. 
- Not here, not now.

953
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:56,431
Fine.

954
00:40:56,625 --> 00:40:58,518
- What's wrong with you? 
- Nothing's wrong with me.

955
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:00,051
Someone could've walked in that door.

956
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,452
And Santa Claus could come down the chimney, whatever.

957
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,822
You did not think that it was going to happen like this, did you?

958
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:06,531
I don't know what I think anymore.

959
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:09,728
Rory, stop, just stop! I did not invite you up here,

960
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:11,100
you came up here on your own!

961
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,942
I don't know what I did.

962
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:18,968
You didn't do anything.

963
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:20,315
Rory...

964
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:24,637
Rory. Are you okay?

965
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,222
Yes. No. I don't know.

966
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,252
hat happened?

967
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:30,760
Figures.

968
00:41:34,084 --> 00:41:34,898
Dean, no.

969
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:57,903
Stop it, guys! Stop it!

970
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:00,781
Young Chui, we gotta talk.

971
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:01,876
Don't touch me, Dave.

972
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:04,134
I'm not gonna touch you. I just think it's time you

973
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:06,095
and I had a real talk about the Lane situation.

974
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:08,390
- Just a talk? 
- We'll keep it friendly, honest.

975
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:11,985
- Ah, get off me! 
- I'm trying.

976
00:42:13,986 --> 00:42:14,590
Bogus.

977
00:42:41,538 --> 00:42:43,090
Guys, just stop it!

978
00:42:43,726 --> 00:42:44,391
Let go of me!

979
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:49,354
Cops.

980
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:53,617
Oh, no, man. Is that...

981
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:54,959
Boy with Toothache.

982
00:42:55,236 --> 00:42:56,080
Oh, you're dead.

983
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,787
Okay, dump your cups and go home.

984
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:05,272
Now.

985
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,685
Jess...

986
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:22,481
Lane...
