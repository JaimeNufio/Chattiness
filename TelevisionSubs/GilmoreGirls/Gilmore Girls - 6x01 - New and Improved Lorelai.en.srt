1
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:03,401
What?

2
00:00:04,236 --> 00:00:07,090
- Luke. Will you -
- Yes.

3
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:10,030
- Well, you don't have to answer so -
- Yes.

4
00:00:10,107 --> 00:00:11,717
- Well, you can take a minute to -
- No.

5
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:19,209
So, what... now?

6
00:00:19,573 --> 00:00:21,557
I don't know. This is new for me.

7
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:23,360
Well, we should do something. Official.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,372
Official.

9
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:27,587
Yeah. Something to commemorate the moment.

10
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:33,685
I mean, we're getting married.

11
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:34,813
Luke.

12
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,402
Married.

13
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:38,869
You and me.

14
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:43,577
Luke table-for-one Danes and

15
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:46,403
Lorelai
I'm-sorry-can-I-get-an-industrial-forklift-

16
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:48,956
for-my-emotional-baggage 
Gilmore are getting

17
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:52,141
married. Huh?

18
00:00:57,288 --> 00:01:00,551
- We could toast.
- Toast! Yes. Toast! Good.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,930
What'll we toast with?

20
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:06,285
Uh -

21
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,177
I mean, I know you won't have champagne,
but maybe some wine or beer or something?

22
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:10,806
Nothing, I've got nothing!

23
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,109
No, you must have something!

24
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:13,581
Grapefruit juice and 
Worcestershire sauce.

25
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:14,802
Neither sounds very festive.

26
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,242
I could cut it with
 some festive ketchup.

27
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,689
No, we need something sparkly.

28
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:22,217
- Come on.
- Huh? Where are we going?

29
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,432
- To Funkytown.
- No, hey, wait!

30
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:27,503
What? Did you change your mind?

31
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:30,986
Oh, how did I screw it up so fast?
Was the Funkytown thing too quippy,

32
00:01:31,052 --> 00:01:33,656
'cause I thought you
 liked that about me, but

33
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:36,261
No, the Funkytown thing 
was fine. I just -

34
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,235
Are you sure you want
 to celebrate now?

35
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,083
I mean, a minute ago,
 when you came in here -

36
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:46,159
I just want to be happy right now.

37
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:48,353
Okay?

38
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,152
Okay.

39
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,333
Good.

40
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,927
Now, come on!

41
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:56,172
Where are we going?

42
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:00,624
Hey, am I doing this right?

43
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:01,855
What?

44
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:03,255
Never mind.

45
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:08,397
That's great, Grandpa, take your time!
I have no home life.

46
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:14,121
Six hours I've been standing here waiting
for this ridiculous race to end! -

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,151
Okay, that's it! Race is over!

48
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,308
Maggie, I want you to start breaking
all this stuff down.

49
00:02:18,378 --> 00:02:21,445
If I don't get these tables back by
midnight I pay for another day.

50
00:02:21,527 --> 00:02:23,452
But we haven't given out the
trophies to the winners yet!

51
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,457
Oh, who cares about giving out the trophies?

52
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,792
There's no-one here to see the winners
get them, except the losers,

53
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:32,747
who I'm sure could give a rat's tushie
if the winners get a trophy or not!

54
00:02:32,831 --> 00:02:34,782
Okay, so do I put them back
in the bubble wrap, or -

55
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,181
Just
- just give it to me. Hey, who was first?

56
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,422
- Here.
- Congratulations. Who's second?

57
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:40,776
- Right here.
- Here.

58
00:02:40,936 --> 00:02:43,352
- Third.
- I wasn't third.

59
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:45,873
Rat's tushie, party of one...

60
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,746
Okay, everybody, listen up!

61
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:53,802
I want this square packed up and
cleared out in ten minutes!

62
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,533
Hey, we're closed!

63
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:59,032
The market is closed!

64
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:01,381
What is wrong with people tonight?

65
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:03,390
- It's closed.
- Ugh. Small-town hours.

66
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:05,966
I hate small-town hours!
As soon as we get married we have to move.

67
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:07,985
Hey, you two, what are you doing there?

68
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,380
Taylor? Great, we need to get in!

69
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:10,904
We open at six tomorrow.

70
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:12,129
Okay, Taylor, listen.

71
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,944
You're going to be the first
one to hear the big news.

72
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:16,755
Do I have to hear it now?
I have so many things to -

73
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:18,390
Luke and I are engaged.

74
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:19,411
You are?

75
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,679
As of just a few minutes ago.

76
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,533
Well, what do you know?
I thought there was a better chance

77
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,165
of all four of the Beatles getting
back together than you two

78
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,219
ever calming down long
 enough to get engaged!

79
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:30,487
Yeah, well, wonder of wonders,
miracle of miracles, right?

80
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,000
Can you just open this door, Taylor?

81
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,126
Well, what do you need in the store?

82
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:35,099
We need something 
to toast this moment with.

83
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,220
Something alcoholic?

84
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:37,143
Yes.

85
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:42,097
You know, Lorelai, if you feel that you
have to be drunk to be with him -

86
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:43,913
Taylor, would you just open the door?

87
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,421
All right.

88
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,255
Where do you keep the champagne?

89
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:52,475
Over there. Top shelf.

90
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:53,011
Where?

91
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,493
Top shelf! Top shelf!

92
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,276
Here?

93
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:58,221
Well, I'm out of ways of saying
"top shelf", Lorelai.

94
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:00,461
Taylor, it's five ninety-nine.

95
00:04:00,537 --> 00:04:02,881
It's inexpensive, yes,
but you'll still get a buzz.

96
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,157
Luke, did you find anything yet?

97
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,741
Nothing. No wine, no
 beer, no cooking sherry.

98
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,849
It's like Dylan Thomas just
blew through town.

99
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:10,829
I'm sorry, these bikers wiped me out.

100
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,561
They may look like health nuts
but they knock it back.

101
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,516
Oh, Taylor, you have to have something!

102
00:04:15,614 --> 00:04:17,977
Lorelai, I'm sorry, 
but - oh, wait a minute!

103
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,782
I think I have a case 
of Zima in the back.

104
00:04:20,876 --> 00:04:23,915
Really? Luke! He's got Zima in the back,
he's got Zima in the back!

105
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:26,726
Yep. Babette had me 
stocking it for a while.

106
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,858
I was using it as a stepstool
but I'm sure it's okay.

107
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:30,681
We'll take it!

108
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:32,823
Let's just drive to Woodbridge.
They have a Liquor Barn there.

109
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,997
No, I don't want to drive all the way to
Woodbridge! I want to celebrate now.

110
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,684
But men aren't supposed to drink Zima.

111
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:37,444
Pay the man.

112
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,387
You can forget the tax.
Consider it an engagement present.

113
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:42,433
Thank you, Taylor! Come on, get the Zima.

114
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:49,109
Get those tables on the truck!

115
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,981
Hustle, people, hustle!

116
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:51,909
Where are you going?

117
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,511
I know the perfect toasting place.

118
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,248
Far?

119
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,253
Which one of us is not getting
into the romantic spirit?

120
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,211
The one with a caseful of
chick beer under his arm.

121
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,853
Shoo. Shoo!

122
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:01,443
Hi, shoo.

123
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:06,533
- Here.
- Right here?

124
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:07,883
- Right here.
- Okay.

125
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:15,272
Okay, so...

126
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:17,246
here's to us.

127
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,678
To us.

128
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:20,954
Taylor!

129
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,893
The light guys go on golden
time in five minutes!

130
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,614
Taylor, turn the lights back on!

131
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,820
Well, fine. Apparently there's
 an oil well in the middle

132
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,050
of Stars Hollow that
 no-one told me about!

133
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,835
Turn them back on, Budgie!

134
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:35,128
Okay.

135
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:37,722
I believe we were right about -

136
00:05:38,887 --> 00:05:39,779
there.

137
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,896
Really?

138
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:45,486
You're going to kiss me now?

139
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,593
So incredibly predictable.

140
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:02,145
Was this mattress 
always this comfortable?

141
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:03,247
I think so.

142
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,554
It seems so much more comfortable.

143
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,503
We should drink Zima and have
sex every single night.

144
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:13,743
- Okay.
- Okay.

145
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,773
- Good night.
- Night.

146
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:24,845
So when I said "what about the kids",
I didn't mean "what about our kids".

147
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,024
I mean, yes, obviously,
 what about our kids?

148
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:31,219
But I didn't mean we
 had to have any kids.

149
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,148
'Cause we don't. But -

150
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:36,520
we can, I just didn't
 want you to think that

151
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:40,291
I was laying down some kind
of a mandate. I mean, kids.

152
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:45,194
It's plural, so it sounds like a lot.
But we can just have one kid,

153
00:07:45,276 --> 00:07:48,880
one's fine, or more if you want more,

154
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,860
or we don't have to have any kids.
We could just

155
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:54,059
get a plant.

156
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:57,181
- What?
- Nothing.

157
00:07:57,629 --> 00:07:58,737
Okay.

158
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,423
I bought a house, Twickham house.
I bought it for us.

159
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:05,735
I don't have it anymore.
I could probably get it back,

160
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:09,120
but I just thought you should know.
I bought it.

161
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:12,710
For the kids, that we don't have to have.

162
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:16,606
It's a big house, and we don't have
to fill it up with kids, you know?

163
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:19,397
We could, we could get furniture.
Go shopping for a couch,

164
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,959
or get some end tables.

165
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:27,073
I hat shopping for furniture. For me,
kids are easier.

166
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:28,786
I love shopping.

167
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:30,032
Go to sleep.

168
00:08:30,196 --> 00:08:31,274
Mmkay.

169
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:34,237
Is this really happening?

170
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:37,446
Yes.

171
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,607
It's really happening.

172
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:50,922
You bought a house without telling me?

173
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:51,774
What?

174
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,737
A house? I mean, a house is huge!

175
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:55,256
Yeah, I know, that's why I told you.

176
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:56,436
A house full of kids?

177
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:57,779
No, a plant, don't forget the plant.

178
00:08:57,861 --> 00:08:59,486
Please don't do that, okay?

179
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:03,697
I mean, any other address
 or life changing decisions?

180
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:04,934
Please include me in!

181
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,589
I will. I am. I'm sorry.

182
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,322
I won't. I will.

183
00:09:10,936 --> 00:09:12,233
Okay.

184
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:15,486
Sorry.

185
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:21,041
Kids would be good.

186
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:27,123
Blueberry pancakes and scrambled eggs.

187
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,328
I didn't ask for blueberries.

188
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:30,968
Antioxidants are on the house today.
Who wants coffee?

189
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,182
Here ya go Trudy!

190
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:37,235
Hey, top that off for you, Mac?

191
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:39,661
What do you say, cup of joe, Joe?

192
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:43,238
Where the heck is he?

193
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,660
There! Right there!

194
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,543
Get over here, you!

195
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:48,054
I can't believe it!

196
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,701
You finally did it, you
 dumb son of a bitch!

197
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,967
You finally got in there
 and closed the deal!

198
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,885
- Took you long enough!
- All right, easy, you two!

199
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,925
You know, we should be very mad at you.

200
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:58,660
Why?

201
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:02,080
Because we had to find out from someone
else that you and Lorelai are engaged!

202
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:03,855
East Side Tilly.

203
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:06,911
She was spreading it around town like she was
going to be a bridesmaid or something.

204
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:09,566
Tilly is not going to be a bridesmaid.

205
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,320
But it's true, you are engaged, right?

206
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:12,429
- Right.
- Right.

207
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:14,268
So we want to hear the whole thing.

208
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,110
- The whole play by play.
- How'd it happen?

209
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:17,454
- How'd you do it?
- Do what?

210
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:19,125
How did you propose to Lorelai?

211
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,272
Oh, uh, well -

212
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:22,504
Did you get down on one knee?

213
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:24,017
Did you take her somewhere special?

214
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,685
Did you hide the ring in anything?

215
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,854
Oh, like a glass of
 champagne, or a cannoli?

216
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:29,925
Actually, I'm still
 working on the ring.

217
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:33,203
Oh! So the proposal 
was spontaneous, huh?

218
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,330
Oh, the spontaneous proposals
 are the best, you know.

219
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:40,606
Yeah, Morey proposed to me spontaneously.
Did I ever tell you the story?

220
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:41,437
Uh, no.

221
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,734
It was a brisk fall night,
and Morey was on top.

222
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:47,015
No, wait, I was on top.

223
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:47,472
What?

224
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,446
Hold on, Stoney Morrison was on top.

225
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:50,205
Babette!

226
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,698
We were playing Twister!
Did I not mention that?

227
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,583
No.

228
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,129
I probably should have.

229
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,836
Well, enough about us, honey.

230
00:10:56,902 --> 00:10:59,871
Come on, Luke, tell us,
 how'd you do it?

231
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:03,195
Well, actually, I didn't...
Lorelai proposed to me.

232
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:05,266
Oh.

233
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,379
You went modern.

234
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,462
Well, that's still okay, sugar.

235
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:13,928
The important thing is,
you're getting married!

236
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:16,122
We're very happy for you, Luke.

237
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,866
- Yes, we are.
- Yeah.

238
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:21,492
Uh-huh, thanks. Well, I've got some
work to do. I'll talk to you guys later.

239
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:26,696
She proposed.

240
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,415
Yeah, well, thank
 God he's got a good ass.

241
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,918
Making you an offer,
 still runs great,

242
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,178
looking for a brand new start.

243
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:40,390
A special,
one-time deal on a pre-owned heart.

244
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:45,378
A special,
one-time deal on a pre-owned heart.

245
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:56,535
Hi.

246
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:58,039
Oh, hello there!

247
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:58,920
For sale again, huh?

248
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:01,367
Yes. We had an offer,
but the buyer backed out.

249
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:03,137
Toxic bachelor type.

250
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:04,945
But we think it'll move fast.

251
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,306
It has all the original fixtures, great
lighting, and a ton of terrific potential.

252
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:10,186
Yeah, it does.

253
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:11,038
Are you interested?

254
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,259
Oh, well, maybe.

255
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,480
It would be a great house for kids.

256
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,207
Oh, please. Not you, too.

257
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,868
I'm sorry, what?

258
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,715
Oh, nothing. Sorry. Thanks!

259
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:25,638
Hello.

260
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,248
Lorelai! Wonderful!

261
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:28,816
How lucky that I caught you.

262
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,273
Now, a few things to go over.

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,144
As you know, Rory's court
 appearance is Tuesday at three.

264
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,140
I've retained the services of Charlie
Davenport as her attorney.

265
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:41,018
You remember Charlie, Lorelai.

266
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:43,159
He bought you a doll 
for your birthday once.

267
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:46,626
Well, he's coming over here tomorrow
morning to discuss Rory's case.

268
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:48,365
About eight-thirty?

269
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:49,436
Sounds super.

270
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:53,196
You know, Charlie doesn't usually
take small cases like this.

271
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,067
He's doing the family a great favor.

272
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,589
Charlie sounds like a swell guy.

273
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:58,960
He is a swell guy, and a top lawyer!

274
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:00,096
You must remember him.

275
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,313
Sure, he bought me a doll
for my birthday once.

276
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:05,132
Well, do you have any questions?

277
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:05,692
Nope.

278
00:13:05,794 --> 00:13:10,414
I have to say, I thought you would have had
more interest in this subject than you seem to.

279
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:12,420
Really? Huh. So is there anything else?

280
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:13,952
No, there isn't anything else!

281
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:15,522
I just wanted to fill you in!

282
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:17,256
Will we see you tomorrow morning?

283
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:17,926
For what?

284
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,527
For the meeting with Charlie Davenport!

285
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,594
Oh, no! It sounds like you have
everything under control.

286
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,281
Fine! I'll talk to you later!

287
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,306
Tell Charlie thanks
 for the doll for me.

288
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,046
Good morning!

289
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:37,179
You're still sleeping? My goodness.
You're young!

290
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:39,148
These are the good days.

291
00:13:39,378 --> 00:13:43,178
There's plenty of time to sleep when you've
gone up a couple of dress sizes.

292
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,649
Is it stuffy in here?

293
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,244
So. Let's talk about this room.

294
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:51,577
Now that you're staying here I thought
we could spruce the place up.

295
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,238
Individualize it to your tastes.

296
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:54,500
You don't have to do anything -

297
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:57,305
I've been dying to get my hands
on this dump for ages,

298
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:59,603
and now I finally have an excuse.

299
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:02,289
Huh. Well, that's insane.

300
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,463
Do you want Hosanna to draw you a bath?

301
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:04,961
No.

302
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,756
Hosanna, draw Rory a bath, please.

303
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:09,443
Hosanna has a pot of coffee for you
in the other room. Interested?

304
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:15,889
Wow!

305
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,448
I brought some fabric samples
to flip through.

306
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:20,354
Oh, the coffee smells amazing.

307
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,668
There's cream in the fridge.

308
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,272
When did you have time to do all this?

309
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:26,955
Oh, it's amazing what you can get done
before eight-thirty in the morning.

310
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:29,431
Now, I've got some things for you.

311
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:33,027
Key to the pool house, key to
the main house, key to the garage.

312
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:36,811
The security alarm code,
the security alarm password,

313
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,806
the number of the security company.

314
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:41,345
Now, the code to the panic room is

315
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:45,302
one, one, one, one, one.

316
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,021
Don't write it down, and whatever you do,
don't tell the maids.

317
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:50,804
They tell their children and then their
children grow up and rob you.

318
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:53,621
Now, is this all your things,
or is there more still at school?

319
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:57,236
Uh, no, I have a lot more. At Mom's.

320
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,030
Oh. Well, don't you worry.
I'll take care of that.

321
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:04,672
Did you try the danish?
I bought it at an organic bakery.

322
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,887
So, how'd it go last night?

323
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,676
Hmm?

324
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:08,774
With Mom.

325
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:13,897
Was she mad? I mean, of course she was mad,
but was it a bad mad?

326
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:16,035
Well, you know your mother, Rory.

327
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:18,142
Everything's the end of the world!
So dramatic.

328
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:20,532
Ladies and gentlemen,
 Lorelai Barrymore.

329
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,153
But don't you worry.

330
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:24,430
She'll calm down,
 just give it some time.

331
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,481
Hello? Is anyone there?

332
00:15:26,737 --> 00:15:28,362
- Come in, please.
- What's that?

333
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:29,850
It's just the intercom.

334
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:32,809
Yes, Richard, we're
 here and we read you!

335
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,146
Copy that, Emily.

336
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:37,310
Is Rory up yet? Charlie Davenport 
is here for our meeting.

337
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:39,843
Well, of course she's
 up, Richard. Please.

338
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,843
You really think she'd still be asleep
at eight-thirty in the morning?

339
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,977
I have her here 
looking at fabric samples.

340
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,579
We'll be done in a minute,
and I'll send her right in.

341
00:15:47,715 --> 00:15:49,101
We'd better get you in that bath!

342
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:50,587
I didn't know there was an intercom!

343
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,608
Isn't that wonderful? We're just
a push-button away, like Star Trek!

344
00:15:54,716 --> 00:15:56,868
Hosanna! We're coming in!

345
00:15:56,966 --> 00:16:01,369
Oh, I don't think that duck stopped
flying until it hit Paraguay!

346
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:05,299
And then, of course,
we came home completely empty-handed.

347
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:06,801
Nothing but our whistles in our hands!

348
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:09,546
You came home empty-handed,
I came home with the Middlin case.

349
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:10,970
Oh, yes, that's right!

350
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:15,217
On this trip, we met Argus Middlin,
CEO of Windermere Technologies.

351
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,734
Paid for his thirty-two million
dollar Maine estate,

352
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:21,129
and his wife's new lower half,
with the company's pension fund!

353
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,469
Ninety-four million dollars
in accounting fraud.

354
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,282
They had him red-handed! On tape, in e-mails,

355
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,729
the man was guilty as sin.
Where is he now, Charlie?

356
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:31,570
Los Angeles.
Just bought Ellen Degeneres' house.

357
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:32,883
So, you got him off?

358
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,708
And successfully sued for
defamation of character!

359
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,611
If you knew the number of truly guilty criminals
put back on the street by this man here,

360
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,056
you'd never believe in the criminal
justice system again.

361
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,271
Now, Richard, I've just realized we've spent
so much time talking about ourselves,

362
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:49,553
we haven't discussed Rory's case at all.

363
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:51,399
She must have a million questions!

364
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,112
Go on, Rory, what would you like to know?

365
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,245
Well, I guess I would just like
to know what's going to happen?

366
00:16:57,337 --> 00:17:01,287
Good question!
Richard, that is a good question!

367
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:02,230
She's a Gilmore.

368
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:05,122
Well, Rory, the first thing that's going
to happen is I'm going to have

369
00:17:05,188 --> 00:17:08,118
a little face-to-face with the prosecutor
that's handling your case,

370
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:10,528
we'll go over things,
I'll take him out for a cup of coffee -

371
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,446
Just don't take him duck-hunting.

372
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:15,169
And then we will agree on a plea bargain.

373
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,291
Really? No trial?

374
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,685
Hell no. Considering you're a first-time
offender with demonstrably excellent character,

375
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,342
not to mention your family's
standing in the community,

376
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:27,024
the most you'll get is a little community
service, ten hours, give or take.

377
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:27,829
Sound good?

378
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,399
Yeah. Sounds very good.

379
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:33,064
Embezzle a pension fund and you'll
really see what he can do.

380
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,424
Now, Richard, I'm afraid I must be going.

381
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,269
We appreciate you coming over like this.

382
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:39,193
Well, of course. Pleasure meeting you, Rory.

383
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:39,803
You too.

384
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,803
I'll walk you out, Charlie.

385
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,192
I'll see you on Tuesday, young lady.

386
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,264
Thank you, Mr. Davenport. I swear,
I will never need your help again.

387
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:46,521
I'm sure you won't.

388
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:48,721
Charming girl.

389
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,572
She certainly is.

390
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:25,479
Rory?

391
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:26,504
In here!

392
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:29,724
You live here?

393
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:30,657
Home, sweet home.

394
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:33,723
Aren't you worried that one night you're going
to sleepwalk right into that pool and drown?

395
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:34,894
I am now.

396
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:35,789
Stuff's in here?

397
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:36,646
Go to town.

398
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:39,231
I'm meeting more of Doyle's family tonight.

399
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,688
I've been meeting people for months.

400
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,020
He's got, like, five hundred cousins.
And you know what?

401
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:44,349
He's the tallest one in the family.

402
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,512
- Really?
- Yep.

403
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,245
Family get-together is like a
Lollipop Guild Convention.

404
00:18:48,364 --> 00:18:51,266
I have to stop myself from asking how
it's going at the chocolate factory.

405
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:52,844
Good, good. Get it all out now.

406
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:54,010
This isn't half bad.

407
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:55,901
Yeah, there's a belt in there
somewhere that matches.

408
00:18:55,988 --> 00:18:58,056
So, I have a matter to discuss with you.

409
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,337
Doyle and I have decided to move in together.

410
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:02,117
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thanks.

411
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:05,430
We have a great duplex right near campus,
lots of room, separate bathrooms,

412
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:09,024
and it's a two-bedroom, so I was thinking
maybe you'd like to move in with us.

413
00:19:09,086 --> 00:19:11,081
Very Bob, Carol, Ted
 and Alice. Minus Bob.

414
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,845
Now, it wouldn't be until school started,
'cause it's rented 'till then.

415
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:15,521
But I think it could
 be a perfect situation.

416
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:18,332
It's a nice offer, Paris, but I can't.

417
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:20,002
I'm not going back to school.

418
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:21,341
You're pregnant.

419
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,188
No!

420
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:23,921
Sick? You look pasty.

421
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:24,848
I'm not sick.

422
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:27,977
Well, I know your National Guard unit didn't
get called up, so what's the story?

423
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:29,839
I'm just taking some time off.

424
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:31,530
No. You don't take time off.

425
00:19:31,607 --> 00:19:34,064
Did you find what you need?
'Cause I have to finish getting ready.

426
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,580
What happened? Something must have happened!

427
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:40,412
Nothing happened. People take time off.

428
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,854
Einstein took a year off!

429
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,273
Yeah.
After he discovered three laws of physics.

430
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,617
I do not have to defend my life to you.

431
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,243
I'm a grown-up, I'm independent.
I'm on my own.

432
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,325
You have no furniture.

433
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,104
Well, I'm redecorating!

434
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:55,770
I want to individualize it to my tastes.

435
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:58,991
Oh. I get it.

436
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,652
I know what this is all about.

437
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:01,735
No, you don't.

438
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:02,908
Sure I do.

439
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:05,339
Paris, just take what
 you need and go, okay?

440
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:07,391
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

441
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:09,407
Paris.

442
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:13,441
You.

443
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,190
I think vacation's coming at
just the right time for her.

444
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,369
I'm ready, let's go.

445
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,252
Did you get robbed?

446
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,370
Uh...

447
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,169
Oh, come on!

448
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:30,728
You should get a real 
cash register, Luke.

449
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:34,597
It's called character, Joe.
It's items like this

450
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:38,385
that give a place character.

451
00:20:38,532 --> 00:20:39,323
Evening, Luke!

452
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,005
Yeah, sit down, Kirk,
 I'll be right with you.

453
00:20:41,118 --> 00:20:43,805
I'm not interested in food, Luke.
I'm here on business.

454
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,733
I hear you might be in
 the market for a ring.

455
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:47,056
Or should I be talking to Lorelai?

456
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:48,282
Go away, Kirk.

457
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,958
Well, then, it's your lucky day.

458
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:55,290
Because I happen to be in possession of the
finest estate ring collection in Connecticut.

459
00:20:55,352 --> 00:20:59,025
And since you are a friend,
I'm prepared to make you a great deal.

460
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:01,080
Or will Lorelai be the one paying for it?

461
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,394
No, she will not be paying for it, Kirk.

462
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:06,180
Ah, East Side Tilly called it wrong,
this time.

463
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:09,081
Look, I'll take care of
finding the ring, okay?

464
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,727
You're sure you don't want to take
a look before you toss me out?

465
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,055
No. I don't.

466
00:21:13,224 --> 00:21:14,271
Nice, huh?

467
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:16,307
Well, yeah.

468
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:17,982
They are nice.

469
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:21,762
Really nice. Wow, look at this one!

470
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:23,731
This is perfect!

471
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:25,516
It looks like Lorelai.

472
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:26,330
It sure does.

473
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:28,895
Yeah. And, these are real?

474
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:29,761
Yes, they are.

475
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:32,014
I mean, real diamonds,
 not "they exist" real?

476
00:21:32,094 --> 00:21:33,515
Diamond and platinum.

477
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:36,531
I have a certificate of authenticity
for every one of these babies.

478
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:37,925
Kirk, where'd you
 get all these rings?

479
00:21:38,008 --> 00:21:40,587
I befriend really old women.

480
00:21:40,658 --> 00:21:41,325
Excuse me?

481
00:21:41,402 --> 00:21:44,746
Really old women need companionship, Luke.
They are really old.

482
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:46,452
Most people they know are dead.

483
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:49,135
So when someone comes along
and they're not dead,

484
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:52,858
and they'll listen to their stories
and care about their dosage,

485
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,009
they are grateful.

486
00:21:54,089 --> 00:21:54,858
Are you serious?

487
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,408
Serious as a heart attack.

488
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:59,130
Which is how I got that ring
you're holding right now.

489
00:21:59,197 --> 00:22:00,356
So what do you think?

490
00:22:00,631 --> 00:22:02,413
I think you've got 
some great choices here.

491
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:03,283
Good.

492
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:06,682
Actually, I have a lot of sympathy
for what you're going through.

493
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,529
What are you talking about, Kirk?

494
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:12,329
Well, Lorelai proposing to you like that,
stealing your thunder.

495
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:15,154
It's got to be embarrassing,
and a little upsetting.

496
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:17,186
Now you'll never have that moment.

497
00:22:17,273 --> 00:22:20,902
You don't get to be the romantic one,
the one to sweep her off her feet.

498
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:21,929
That's got to hurt.

499
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:23,425
I'm fine, Kirk.

500
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,343
Well, sure, what else
 are you going to say?

501
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:29,063
You know, I've been getting pretty
close to proposing to Lulu myself,

502
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:31,775
and when I heard what happened to you,
it really freaked me out.

503
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,472
I mean, if Lorelai can just
spring it on you like that,

504
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:36,764
what's to stop Lulu from springing it on me?

505
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:39,758
Your creepy friendships with really
old women might do the trick.

506
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,876
Well, I've been avoiding her for two days.

507
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,491
Hanging up on her really
quickly when she calls.

508
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:48,282
She may be mad, but there's no way she's
going to rob me of my moment.

509
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:50,410
Well, don't you 
feel sorry for me, Kirk.

510
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,009
I'm going to have my moment.

511
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,856
But it's gone.

512
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:56,901
Trust me, I'll have it. Case closed.
Now, here. I'll take this one.

513
00:22:57,107 --> 00:22:59,706
Ah, old widow Mason.

514
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:02,250
Thought she was Frieda
 Callow toward the end.

515
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,413
So, drink, dinner, movie,
that's really what we're doing tonight?

516
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,142
I don't understand why you
won't just believe me.

517
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:10,679
I'm tired, I just want a mellow
evening with my girlfriend.

518
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:13,030
Last time you were mellow you
had a hundred and four fever

519
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:16,628
and even then, we were bar-hopping
for an hour before you fainted.

520
00:23:16,714 --> 00:23:18,397
I didn't faint, I passed out.

521
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:20,008
Drink, dinner, 
and a movie, that's it.

522
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:20,762
Fine.

523
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:27,890
For she's a jolly good felon,
for she's a jolly good felon.

524
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:31,956
For she's a jolly good felon!

525
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:35,360
Which nobody can deny!

526
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,850
After the party, that is!

527
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:44,012
- How much longer?
- Oh, sorry.

528
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:48,089
There's a purse-shoe incident that's
threatening the entire outcome of the ensemble.

529
00:23:48,166 --> 00:23:49,709
It's technical,
 you wouldn't understand.

530
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:52,668
I don't want to understand,
I want to leave. I'm starving.

531
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:53,806
Watch T.V.

532
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,332
How is that a response to "I'm starving"?

533
00:23:56,997 --> 00:24:00,176
Hey, why don't you answer the door?
That would be fun for ya.

534
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,134
I'm not bored because I'm six.

535
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:06,339
I'm bored because you told me to pick you
up at seven, and it's eight-thirty.

536
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:09,841
Who are you?

537
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:10,904
Well, I'm -

538
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,637
I need to talk to Lorelai.
 Where is she?

539
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,724
Lorelai! Where are you?

540
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,518
Who's that?

541
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:17,754
It's Paris,
and I need to talk to you right now!

542
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:19,518
- Who are you?
- Well, I tried to tell you -

543
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,954
Paris! What are you doing here?

544
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,369
Are you busy? Is this a bad time?

545
00:24:23,446 --> 00:24:25,592
No, we're just getting ready to go out.
It's fine.

546
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,216
- Um, have you met Luke?
- No.

547
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:28,405
- I'm Luke.
- Paris.

548
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:30,076
- Nice to -
- Rory's quitting Yale.

549
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:33,001
I just went to see her and she told me she's
quitting Yale. Did you know about this?

550
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,011
Yes, I did.

551
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,436
It's Logan. That Christopher
 Atkins wannabe is the reason

552
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:38,564
that she's suddenly Blue Lagoon-ing
it right out of school.

553
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,846
- Paris -
- I don't understand.

554
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:41,953
- Why are you letting her do it?
- I have no choice.

555
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:43,368
Yes, you do. You can stop her.

556
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,557
You can pull some of that supermom
crap that you always do

557
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:47,379
- and get her to change her mind!
- Yep.

558
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:49,265
Rory can't quit Yale!
We have to do something!

559
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:49,870
I agree.

560
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,148
I mean, we should kidnap her.

561
00:24:51,215 --> 00:24:54,393
Drag her back here and tie her up and not let
her loose until she listens to reason.

562
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,456
- Yes.
- Luke.

563
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,009
Hey, my suggestion first.

564
00:24:57,081 --> 00:24:58,834
I need her to be at Yale.

565
00:24:58,907 --> 00:25:02,184
Rory has been my only real competition
since she showed up at Chilton!

566
00:25:02,259 --> 00:25:04,091
She's the only one who has
ever challenged me.

567
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:06,486
She's my pace car. She's my Bjorn Borg.

568
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:10,059
Without her, I'll get lazy. I'll fall apart.
I'll have frosted hair

569
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:12,993
and dragon-lady nails and I'll achieve
nothing! I'll become my mother!

570
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,106
Paris. Listen to me. You are a very smart,
driven young lady.

571
00:25:17,177 --> 00:25:19,465
You can be anything you want.
Except a diplomat.

572
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:21,080
You don't need Rory to push you.

573
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:22,403
Rory's my only friend.

574
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:26,049
She stays in the room until I'm completely
done saying something. I need that.

575
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:28,085
Listen. I know I'm not Rory,

576
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:31,412
but if you need to talk to someone
you can always call me.

577
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:32,454
- Really?
- Yeah.

578
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,161
I mean, I'll give you
 my cell phone number.

579
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,028
Basically my lifeline.

580
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:37,858
You take it and you use it.

581
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:38,982
I can really call you?

582
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:41,058
Anytime, anywhere.

583
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:42,587
I'm going to hold you to that.

584
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,130
It's not a threat, sweetie,
if somebody makes the offer willingly.

585
00:25:45,197 --> 00:25:46,782
Okay. Thanks.

586
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:48,278
Sorry to bother you.

587
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:49,525
Bye, Luke.

588
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:50,778
Nice to meet -

589
00:25:52,212 --> 00:25:54,648
And that concludes the floor
show portion of the evening.

590
00:25:54,715 --> 00:25:56,140
I'll get my purse and we'll go.

591
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:01,585
- So what are you going to do?
- About what?

592
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:02,745
- You know about what.
- Nothing.

593
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:04,083
- Come on.
- Come on, let's just go!

594
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,704
No. We haven't talked about this.

595
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:06,792
Because there's nothing to talk about.

596
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:07,810
Yes there is.

597
00:26:07,893 --> 00:26:10,319
Luke. This is Rory's decision, okay?

598
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:13,672
She knew exactly how I felt about the
situation, and she chose to ignore me.

599
00:26:13,727 --> 00:26:16,012
She chose to move in with my parents.
She chose not to tell me about it.

600
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:17,560
- She's a kid.
- She's not a kid!

601
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:19,764
She's twenty.
She's going to be twenty-one in October.

602
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:22,362
She's been living on her own for
two years now. She's not a kid.

603
00:26:22,426 --> 00:26:23,866
Okay, fine. But she's young.

604
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:27,266
And young people have to be
allowed to make mistakes.

605
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:30,003
I made a much bigger mistake than
this when I was much younger.

606
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:33,364
Oh, so what? Just because you made
it on your own, Rory has to also?

607
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:34,807
- That's not my point.
- Well, then, what is your point?

608
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:38,163
My point is that I wouldn't have listened
to anyone in that situation,

609
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:41,134
even if there was someone to listen to.
I had to go through that

610
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,158
and Rory has to go through this.

611
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:46,645
Now, she's smart and she's strong.
Hopefully she'll figure it out,

612
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:48,189
but I am not going to force my way in!

613
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:49,946
She wants to be on her own, fine,
she's on her own.

614
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,337
- Really.
- Tough love, baby.

615
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:53,034
- So that's it.
- That's it.

616
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:55,030
And you're okay with this?

617
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:57,384
I'm totally okay with this.

618
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,670
Come on, let's go.
I thought you were starving.

619
00:27:02,552 --> 00:27:05,112
Did you give Paris
 your real cell number?

620
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:08,747
My best sloth year, I believe,
was sophomore year.

621
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:11,931
I went to Spain for a week to
immerse myself in Cervantes,

622
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:15,362
wound up staying for two months and almost
joined the French Foreign Legion.

623
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:16,604
But you were in Spain!

624
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:19,675
Yes, but Sinatra didn't sing about
the Spanish Foreign Legion.

625
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:21,397
Could you pass me three peanuts?

626
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,633
Two months is nothing.

627
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,391
Oh, so you think you can outdo me?

628
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,500
Freshman year, four and a half months
cross country road trip.

629
00:27:27,577 --> 00:27:29,576
This was pre-navigational systems, people.

630
00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:31,654
In junior year,
I dropped my things off at my dorm room,

631
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,355
jumped on a plane to Australia
and surfed until Christmas.

632
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:35,519
- You did not.
- I did.

633
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:36,274
Where was I?

634
00:27:36,332 --> 00:27:37,822
In class, like a good little boy.

635
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,053
Amazing. They're actually
 having a loser-off.

636
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,026
Oh, look how she mocks.
 The girl stayed home

637
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,206
for a month after
 she had a tragic haircut.

638
00:27:44,273 --> 00:27:47,124
It wasn't a tragic haircut.
It was apocalyptic highlights.

639
00:27:47,188 --> 00:27:48,480
I looked like a Tim Burton character.

640
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,047
Two more peanuts. Little ones.

641
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,119
Hey, Logan, do you remember that
time that you left a classroom

642
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,303
to make an entrance for that mock debate
and you ended up in Atlantic City?

643
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:55,949
Vaguely.

644
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:00,371
Now, this man, here, my darling,
is the long-reigning King of the Sloths.

645
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:02,606
That's right. No one can waste 
time like this man here.

646
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:04,626
- Really?
- No. Now who wants a drink?

647
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:06,538
Oh, he's just being modest.

648
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:10,530
Logan has a talent for doing nothing that's
yet to be matched by man... or actual sloth.

649
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,591
Okay, I feel a lipstick 
crisis coming on.

650
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,515
- I'll be right back.
- I'll go with you.

651
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:17,181
King of the Sloths, huh?

652
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,852
I don't know. This year I might
give you a run for your money.

653
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:20,936
Oh, really?

654
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:24,133
Yes. All Kings must
 be de-throned eventually.

655
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,283
And this year that crown will be mine.

656
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:29,955
All hail Rory Gilmore,
future Queen of the Sloths.

657
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:31,143
All hail.

658
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:34,765
All right, time to make the rounds.
See which one of these lovely females

659
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:37,314
is soused enough to find
my arrogance charming.

660
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,708
Finn, have you ever thought
about just wooing a woman?

661
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:42,692
Flowers, chocolates,
a little slow jam in the background?

662
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,887
Slow jams are for the subtle, Rory.

663
00:28:44,953 --> 00:28:47,415
"One too many" has 
a delightful immediacy.

664
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,348
- You coming, Colin?
- Absolutely.

665
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,216
I wonder how beer tastes
with ice cream in it.

666
00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:56,931
I give you one month.

667
00:28:57,046 --> 00:28:58,142
To do what?

668
00:28:58,255 --> 00:29:01,205
Before you're back at school. One month.

669
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,532
You are wrong.

670
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:03,541
Nope.

671
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:07,835
Oh, I cannot believe how little
faith you have in me.

672
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:09,568
I mean, what kind of
 match would I be for you

673
00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:13,961
if I just went running right back
to a life of respectability

674
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,890
without even attempting to join
the French Foreign Legion?

675
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:18,208
You love school.

676
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:19,474
Not anymore.

677
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,438
No. You love school.

678
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,336
I saw it. That doesn't just go away.

679
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,509
Well, I have reformed, all right?

680
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:28,796
From now on, no more scheduling.
No more planning.

681
00:29:28,857 --> 00:29:32,401
I am just going to spend my days
making ice cream beer floats

682
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,485
and just taking life as it
 comes. You'll see. New me.

683
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:37,540
- If you say so.
- I do say so.

684
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:39,242
Come on, come on! I love this song.

685
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:43,640
We need to dance the booze off,
or else one of us is going home with Finn.

686
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:45,458
Oh, this is for a good cause.

687
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:46,293
Take her.

688
00:29:46,366 --> 00:29:49,746
Okay, save my seat.
And order me a scoop of vanilla!

689
00:29:56,791 --> 00:29:58,738
You have a really nice place here. Really.

690
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:02,159
I slept incredible last night.
I woke up to birds singing.

691
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,770
Seriously, this town is so great.

692
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:07,139
I just had to take one last early morning
ride around the town before I checked out.

693
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:08,933
I can't wait to tell
 people about this place.

694
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,442
Hmm. Could you move
 your arm, please?

695
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:13,503
- Huh?
- Your arm. That one.

696
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:14,523
Okay.

697
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:19,891
Uh, hi. How's your bill looking?
Everything okay?

698
00:30:19,954 --> 00:30:21,286
Yeah, my bill's fine.

699
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,979
Okay, well, I'll put this in an
envelope for you, and I'll be right back.

700
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:25,835
It's been a pleasure 
having you stay with us.

701
00:30:26,318 --> 00:30:28,016
Hand me an envelope,
don't ever do that again!

702
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,799
Sweating all over the desk.

703
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:31,712
He's paying a six hundred
 dollar hotel bill.

704
00:30:31,773 --> 00:30:34,363
I don't care. 
He smells, they all smell.

705
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,692
The whole inn smell like sweat
socks and damp nylon shorts.

706
00:30:37,743 --> 00:30:38,947
It's making me sick.

707
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:40,651
I have to work at that desk,

708
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:44,297
and I have no intention of catching
jock itch on my forearm

709
00:30:44,353 --> 00:30:47,049
because Mr. Breaking Away
over there can't shower

710
00:30:47,114 --> 00:30:48,752
before he invades my dance space.

711
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:50,110
Michel, just chill
 out with the spray, okay?

712
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:50,895
- Fine.
- Thank you.

713
00:30:50,948 --> 00:30:53,060
Oh, by the way,
your mother called a few minutes ago.

714
00:30:53,137 --> 00:30:55,276
She says she wants to pick up
the rest of Rory's things

715
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,823
and she will be at your house at eleven.

716
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:57,741
Fine.

717
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:01,056
Hey, whoa! There's your bill, there.

718
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:03,828
So, um, everything 
all set with your bags?

719
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:04,710
Yeah.

720
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:08,325
Good, well, thank you for staying at
the Dragonfly, we hope to see you soon.

721
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:10,193
The cart's outside to
 take you to your car.

722
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,034
Okay, thanks!

723
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,367
Thank you.

724
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:20,028
- Michel.
- I'm all over it.

725
00:31:31,118 --> 00:31:32,947
Hello, won't you come in.

726
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,398
All right. Thank you.

727
00:31:39,777 --> 00:31:40,952
What are you doing here?

728
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:43,763
I was sent to open
 the door like a servant.

729
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:44,624
What?

730
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:45,623
Where's Lorelai?

731
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,804
I don't know.
She doesn't keep the help informed.

732
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,115
- She's not here?
- No. I am here.

733
00:31:51,183 --> 00:31:55,695
I am here, and not at the Dragonfly Inn,
which I theoretically run,

734
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:58,545
when I'm not busy 
answering door like Benson.

735
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:00,290
I don't understand. 
You gave her my message?

736
00:32:00,406 --> 00:32:03,684
I gave her your message and she told
me to come over here and let you in.

737
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:07,469
Just like I'm a puppy, fetching 
slippers and getting my liver treat.

738
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,299
- But... - I don't
- did she leave anything for me?

739
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:11,770
She left me.

740
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:14,848
But - I just - I can't -

741
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:16,787
well, this is absolutely incredible.

742
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:19,206
Does she think this 
is a funny thing to do?

743
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:21,396
I drive all the 
way from Hartford -

744
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,852
She did nothing!

745
00:32:23,997 --> 00:32:26,099
Nothing's packed,
 nothing's ready to go!

746
00:32:26,242 --> 00:32:27,704
Where are Rory's good clothes?

747
00:32:27,775 --> 00:32:31,446
I don't know, but I will continue
to search for them frantically.

748
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:33,125
Are you just going to sit there?

749
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:36,236
I was instructed to
 stay until you leave.

750
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:37,539
Like I need to be watched.

751
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:40,919
Like I'm a meth head stealing a television
set to support my habit.

752
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,671
Well, this is completely unacceptable!
Rory needs something to wear to court!

753
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,092
I'm sorry, if you're talking to me,
you'll have to do it in woofs.

754
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:51,031
You've been working with my
daughter way too long.

755
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:54,164
Don't I know it.

756
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:58,246
Well, I have to say,
this is a charming little courtroom.

757
00:32:58,336 --> 00:33:00,503
Reminds me of my early days practicing law.

758
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,604
It is quaint.

759
00:33:02,071 --> 00:33:03,866
I hope we picked the right outfit here.

760
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:06,415
It's coming off a little more
Mennonite than I had hoped.

761
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,276
The girl looks fine, Emily. Leave her alone.

762
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:09,107
Are you nervous?

763
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:09,682
No.

764
00:33:09,814 --> 00:33:12,312
And you shouldn't be. Everything will be
fine, it'll be over before you know it.

765
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:15,003
Court calls the state
 versus Lorelai Gilmore.

766
00:33:15,085 --> 00:33:16,788
Who is Lorelai Gilmore?

767
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,947
I am. That's my real name.

768
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,999
Good thing I found out about it now.
Could have been a little embarrassing later.

769
00:33:23,896 --> 00:33:26,884
Rory! Rory, unbutton 
the sweater a little.

770
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:28,081
Emily, stop it!

771
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:30,031
I don't want her to look like
she's trying too hard.

772
00:33:30,115 --> 00:33:32,500
I understand that a plea agreement
has been reached.

773
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:33,660
That's correct, your Honor.

774
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,408
Miss Gilmore, please stand.

775
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,381
You understand that you're pleading
guilty to criminal mischief

776
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:43,388
in the third degree in violation of
section 117A of the penal code?

777
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:44,300
Yes, your honor.

778
00:33:44,382 --> 00:33:46,581
You further understand that by
so doing you waive your right

779
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,541
to a trial by a jury of your peers?

780
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:49,398
I do.

781
00:33:49,478 --> 00:33:51,834
I see that community 
service is recommended?

782
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:54,012
Miss Gilmore has no 
prior record, your Honor.

783
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,490
No history of getting into trouble.

784
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:57,218
Twenty hours of community service?

785
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,607
This was a youthful
 indiscretion, your Honor.

786
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,751
A one-time, childish lark.

787
00:34:01,848 --> 00:34:07,406
My client is duly remorseful and I can
assure you, it will never happen again.

788
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:11,187
I see you're a student at Yale.

789
00:34:11,278 --> 00:34:12,109
Yes, your Honor.

790
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:13,612
That's a very nice school.

791
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:14,467
Prestigious.

792
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,329
Yes, your Honor.

793
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:18,724
I understand the defense is portraying
this as a childish lark.

794
00:34:18,776 --> 00:34:20,730
A youthful indiscretion.

795
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:23,144
Well, I take the law very seriously.

796
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:26,102
And if there's one thing I have
very little tolerance for,

797
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,473
it's rich, privileged children viewing
the world as their private playground!

798
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:32,123
I don't care who you are!

799
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:33,897
I don't care who your family is.

800
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:36,092
When you commit a crime, Miss Gilmore,

801
00:34:36,185 --> 00:34:39,057
there must be consequences. Period.

802
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:41,754
Twenty hours of community
service won't do it.

803
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:44,390
I'm ordering three hundred
hours of community service

804
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:47,066
to be completed in 
no more than six months,

805
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:48,871
and one year's probation.

806
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:52,537
But I can't do three
 hundred hours. I -

807
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:53,774
I have to get a job!

808
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:56,654
Well. Add that to your list of things
you should have thought about

809
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:59,870
before you decided to joyride
on someone else's boat!

810
00:34:59,942 --> 00:35:02,367
Three hundred hours, but this
 is outrageous! Charlie!

811
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:06,076
Now, assuming this is
 a one-time occurrence,

812
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:08,787
at the end of five year's time,
Miss Gilmore can petition the court

813
00:35:08,844 --> 00:35:10,676
to have this expunged from her record.

814
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:12,696
Record? She's going to have a record?
Oh, my God!

815
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:14,333
You never said
 anything about a record!

816
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:15,169
Richard, please.

817
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:17,721
Don't "Richard, please" me,
you two-bit double-talker!

818
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:18,859
Who are you? Sit down.

819
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:22,178
I am her grandfather, Richard Gilmore,
and this is outrageous!

820
00:35:22,227 --> 00:35:24,068
I never should have let her
go with the ponytail.

821
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:26,506
You are going to have to
restrain yourself, sir.

822
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:28,131
I will not restrain myself!

823
00:35:28,218 --> 00:35:32,050
I will not stand by and let this girl walk
around with a record for five years!

824
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:33,515
Richard, you're standing on my foot!

825
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:34,848
I should never have listened to you.

826
00:35:34,955 --> 00:35:37,822
Making deals with a twenty year
old child in a cheap suit!

827
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:38,376
Hey!

828
00:35:38,453 --> 00:35:41,295
I'm not duty-bound to do so,
but I'm happy to give Miss Gilmore

829
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:44,637
the opportunity to withdraw
her plea and go to trial.

830
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:47,904
If she does so,
she'll face additional felony charges.

831
00:35:47,986 --> 00:35:52,351
Given the undisputed facts, I'd think very
hard about that course of action.

832
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:53,873
Well, I think it's 
something to consider!

833
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,653
Grandpa, no! I don't 
want to go to trial!

834
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:58,165
I'll do the community service!
Please, just sit down!

835
00:35:58,242 --> 00:35:59,356
Richard, sit down!

836
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:01,211
I do not want to withdraw my plea,
your Honor.

837
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,175
All right.

838
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,785
I will consider this matter settled.

839
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:07,805
Court will recess 
for twenty minutes.

840
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,109
All rise.

841
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,457
This is not that big a deal.

842
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:13,796
Well, we got a little more community
service than we wanted.

843
00:36:13,883 --> 00:36:15,964
You're a lousy duck-hunter, Charlie.

844
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:19,246
It wasn't the weather,
and it wasn't the duck-call, it was you.

845
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:21,313
I was doing you a favor, Richard.

846
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,789
Well! Do me some more favors, Charlie!

847
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:26,275
Let's see if we can get the girl
twenty to life at Sing Sing!

848
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,194
That is it!

849
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:27,881
Grandpa.

850
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,810
I'm hiring a lawyer to sue that man.

851
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:31,871
Grandpa, did you tell mom
about the court date?

852
00:36:31,949 --> 00:36:32,768
Of course I did.

853
00:36:32,844 --> 00:36:35,469
You did? You told her the time and
where it was and everything?

854
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:38,767
She knew all about it, Rory,
she simply showed no interest in the matter.

855
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:40,979
- Abe Rosenstein!
- Who?

856
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,999
That's who I'm going to get to sue Charlie.

857
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:44,219
Good-bye, Emily.

858
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:47,136
Go to hell, Richard.

859
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,937
I'm not through with you yet!

860
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,162
Richard, you can't kill him here!
We're in the courthouse!

861
00:37:12,658 --> 00:37:13,981
Lorelai, it's your mother.

862
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:16,895
I want to thank you for the lovely little
surprise you left me this morning.

863
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:19,571
I can't wait to tell the girls
at the club all about it.

864
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:23,831
I mean, they're always bragging about their
daughter did this and their daughter did that.

865
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:26,616
Well, finally I get to go in
there and say, "Oh, really?

866
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:30,090
Well, today my daughter invited me
over and then didn't show up.

867
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,010
And then she had me watched by
a surly barking Frenchman

868
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:34,482
so that I didn't steal anything!"

869
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,807
I didn't invite you over, mother!

870
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,898
"Top that, ladies!"
This was unforgivable, Lorelai.

871
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,729
Disgraceful behavior,
even by your standards.

872
00:37:41,857 --> 00:37:45,606
And since I assume you've torn up all
of my notes, I'll read them to you.

873
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,899
I made copies.

874
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:51,075
"Dear Lorelai,
I was shocked and saddened by your decision

875
00:37:51,123 --> 00:37:54,004
not to be at home when I came
by for Rory's things. "

876
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:58,205
My God.

877
00:37:58,627 --> 00:38:00,317
There. There's all of her stuff.

878
00:38:00,524 --> 00:38:01,411
You happy?

879
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:03,867
Lorelai, you scared me half to death!

880
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:06,789
Yeah, well, follow-through has
always been my problem. Oh, well.

881
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:10,819
Um, so, we've got clothes, books,
stuffed animals.

882
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:13,507
I even checked the laundry to make sure
nothing was waiting to be washed.

883
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,291
Okay? Are we good?

884
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:17,142
What do you mean, barging in here in
the middle of the night? Are you crazy?

885
00:38:17,203 --> 00:38:19,748
Mom just seemed extremely concerned about
getting the rest of Rory's things.

886
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:21,506
She needed something to wear to court.

887
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,784
Yeah, so I figured I'd better bring them
right over here, so now I did. So I'm done.

888
00:38:24,861 --> 00:38:28,265
Lorelai, stop this. I know you're upset.
I know you hate us, but -

889
00:38:28,327 --> 00:38:29,988
I don't hate you. Why would I hate you?

890
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,403
Well, because we -
 because you thought we -

891
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,849
You were just being you.
You couldn't help it.

892
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,860
What are you talking about?

893
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:38,342
The scorpion and the frog.

894
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:40,942
It's an old story.
The scorpion says to the frog,

895
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:43,645
"Hey, frog. Give me a lift to
the other side of the pond. "

896
00:38:43,726 --> 00:38:46,003
Frog says, "No way.
You'll sting me and I'll die. "

897
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,311
Scorpion says, "Will not!
'Cause then we'd both drown. "

898
00:38:48,387 --> 00:38:49,429
Frog says "Cool. "

899
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:53,183
So, scorpion gets on the frog's back,
and frog makes it to the middle of the pond,

900
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:56,028
and the scorpion stings him.
As the frog is going down, he says,

901
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:58,398
"Why would you do that? 
Now we'll both die. "

902
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,064
Scorpion says, "Sorry,
 it's just my nature. "

903
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,373
Frog. Scorpion.

904
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:05,201
I always thought it was a turtle.

905
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:06,879
Whatever it was. 
You guys couldn't help it.

906
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,007
Lorelai, why don't you 
sit and calm down?

907
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:10,309
I am calm. I'm fine.

908
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,813
You guys must be pretty jazzed, though, huh?
I mean, you finally did it,

909
00:39:12,858 --> 00:39:15,966
you finally got a shot at getting the
daughter you've always wanted.

910
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:17,740
I'm too tired to have this conversation.

911
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:20,355
Rory. Here, right under
 your roof. Excellent.

912
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:21,617
You're being ridiculous.

913
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:25,427
Now you get your do-over.
A new and improved Lorelai.

914
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,990
Congrats. Very well played.

915
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:29,551
Lorelai, listen to me.

916
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:33,139
I know that you think some sort of
con has been perpetrated on you.

917
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:34,497
Hey, it's only a paper moon, Dad.

918
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:38,267
The fact of the matter is, your mother and
I were just trying to do the right thing.

919
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,272
We're all striving for the same goal.

920
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:42,360
We want Rory happy and healthy.

921
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:44,170
Now, she's taken a bit of a stumble.

922
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:47,476
But we can get her back on the right track.
All of us, together.

923
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:51,882
We're going to need your input and
your involvement to achieve that.

924
00:39:51,942 --> 00:39:54,542
My involvement ends here,
with the laundry basket.

925
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:56,374
What is that flip remark supposed to mean?

926
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,886
It's supposed to mean that I'm out.
You've won. She's all yours.

927
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:02,220
Course, the laundry basket,
I'm going to want back.

928
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:09,880
Please, Luke. Please?
Please, please, please, please. Please!

929
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:10,633
No.

930
00:40:10,717 --> 00:40:12,542
Luke, I have to have the ring back!

931
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:16,132
Kirk, I paid you for the ring. In fact,
I've overpaid you for the ring.

932
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,138
You gave me a certificate of authenticity

933
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,111
and a promise that none of the heirs
are going to sue me for possession,

934
00:40:21,173 --> 00:40:22,454
and that our business was done!

935
00:40:22,537 --> 00:40:26,305
Luke, you don't understand. I think that
was the ring that Lulu had her eye on.

936
00:40:26,366 --> 00:40:28,563
I'd totally forgotten this until
- where are you going?

937
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,551
I'm leaving, Kirk! The diner's closed!

938
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:32,245
You can't leave until I get that ring back!

939
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:33,871
If I propose, I'm going to need that ring.

940
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:35,614
You have a suitcase full of rings!

941
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,531
But that's the one that I sort
of remembered her liking.

942
00:40:37,618 --> 00:40:38,510
Pick another ring!

943
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:40,422
But my backup ring pulled through.

944
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:43,228
Plus, now there's talk of her
wanting to be buried with it.

945
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:44,624
Good night, Kirk.

946
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:47,274
- Luke! Wait!
- Oh, boy.

947
00:40:47,346 --> 00:40:49,079
I have to talk to you!

948
00:40:49,162 --> 00:40:52,361
Okay, Babette! Slow down,
I'm not going anywhere.

949
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,479
- It's very serious!
- I'm right here.

950
00:40:54,556 --> 00:40:56,847
Just
- you can walk, Babette, just walk, Babette.

951
00:40:56,909 --> 00:41:00,115
Please, walk. Slow down! Just - whoa!

952
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:03,668
Ah, geez! Oh my God. I smell toast.

953
00:41:03,776 --> 00:41:07,212
I smell toast and almonds.
I smell almond toast.

954
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:08,299
Yeah, well, what do you need, Babette?

955
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,211
I need confirmation on a rumor.

956
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:13,156
There's a rumor that there's been
a rift between Lorelai and Rory!

957
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:14,058
A rift?

958
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:17,411
Big rift, very serious!
That's why Rory ain't home for the summer?

959
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:18,042
Wow.

960
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:18,903
Who told you this?

961
00:41:18,986 --> 00:41:21,862
Well, who else? East Side Tilly.
That damn woman keep trumping me.

962
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:24,217
So come on, is she right? Is it true?

963
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:28,502
It is true. Oh my God. Well, what happened?
And how's Lorelai taking it?

964
00:41:28,538 --> 00:41:30,416
She must be a basket case!
Oh, is she a basket case?

965
00:41:30,481 --> 00:41:35,091
Okay, stop! Look, look. There's been a little
incident, but it's all going to be fine.

966
00:41:35,155 --> 00:41:37,340
Lorelai has it completely under control.

967
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:39,763
- She's okay?
- Trust me. She's just fine.

968
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:44,758
Nice ring.

969
00:42:50,846 --> 00:42:53,534
Full moon! Moment's here, let's go!
