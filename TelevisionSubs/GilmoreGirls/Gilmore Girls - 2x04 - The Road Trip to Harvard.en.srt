1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:04,004
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,548
Max has asked me to marry him.

3
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:07,674
Yeah, I figured.

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,511
Goodness.

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,014
- You should elope and get it over with.
- No one asked you.

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,641
My parents are sending me to Korea.

7
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,101
Guess who doesn't possess
his own set of keys yet.

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,311
I'm guessing it's you.

9
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:21,855
They won't tell me when I'm coming back.

10
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm trying really hard
not to read too much into this.

11
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,318
I just thought you should know.

12
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,655
My parents brought the suitcase
that I'm supposed to take on my trip.

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,990
- We're getting married, Lorelai.
- I know.

14
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,327
That means we're taking two separate
lives and melding them together.

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,955
- How do you think that's going to work?
- I don't know.

16
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,375
- Have you given it any thought at all?
- Not really.

17
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,919
People can evolve together,
don't you think?

18
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,003
Maybe.

19
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,672
- Pack.
- What?

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,799
- Pack.
- What's going on?

21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,300
We are hitting the road.

22
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,719
- Are you and Max getting married?
- No.

23
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,763
So, are we almost there?

24
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:58,350
We're almost there and nowhere near it.
All that matters is we're going.

25
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,144
- Practically gone already.
- Look out, world.

26
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:07,818
No music.
I can't believe we forgot to bring tunes.

27
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,904
Do you realize neither of us
has the vaguest idea where we are?

28
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:14,575
- What is a road trip without tunes?
- The sun is directly behind us.

29
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:18,245
I've never been in this car for a long period
of time without playing AC/DC.

30
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,831
- I don't know where it's going.
- I need Highway to Hell.

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,124
It's right out the windshield.

32
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,459
The radio's only playing Top 40
and Christian rock.

33
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,754
'Christian rock. ' There's an oxymoron.
I need my tunes!

34
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:31,216
- Stop complaining about the tunes.
- Stop complaining about our location.

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,635
My complaint is legitimate.
Yours is infantile.

36
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,053
Okay, you're right.

37
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,847
Nonstop Country...

38
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,226
Yes, country music. Must be my lucky day.

39
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,896
- We have to figure out where we're going.
- No, we don't.

40
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,648
- Mom.
- The point of this is to be spontaneous...

41
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,861
to drive and land someplace we've
never been and never expected to be.

42
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,738
- Sounds risky.
- Sounds exciting.

43
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,573
Serendipity has never been kind to us.

44
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,451
Yes, but I talked to Serendipity
on the phone last night.

45
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,037
She feels bad
about how she's treated us in the past.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,415
We had a nice chat.
It's all gonna be different now.

47
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,960
What did that sign say?
It said 'Don't' or 'Death' on it.

48
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,046
- Relax.
- We're doomed.

49
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,925
- Wrong. We're being guided by fate.
- I think we're lost.

50
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,385
We can't be lost.
We don't know where we're going.

51
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,305
You're going to stop
before we drive into the Atlantic Ocean?

52
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,891
- I'll try.
- At least we'll know where we are.

53
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,935
Unless it's the Pacific.

54
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,483
Coming up, a three-song superset
from Hootie & the Blowfish.

55
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:31,503
- You know what? I love road food.
- I love it, too.

56
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,339
What could be better
than the food at Haden's Nut House?

57
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,217
- Unless you don't like nuts.
- As if those people exist.

58
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,344
If I was in a rock band, touring and stuff...

59
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,264
I'd make the driver stop
at every Haden's Nut House we passed.

60
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,267
Wow, your Behind the Music
is gonna be really wild.

61
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,812
Okay, so if we continue
on the way we've been going...

62
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,564
- Who are you calling?
- Sookie.

63
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,732
Now?

64
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,319
I didn't get to call her before we left,
so she doesn't know about the...

65
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,656
- You okay?
- I guess. It's just...

66
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,450
Hi, Sookie, it's me.

67
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,660
Hi, sweetie. You on your way in?

68
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,245
No, not yet.

69
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,457
Actually, I'm gonna be out of town
for a couple of days.

70
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,251
- What?
- Yeah, Rory and I decided to hit the road.

71
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,046
But how can you do that?
You're supposed to be getting...

72
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,508
- The engagement is off, Sookie.
- What? What happened?

73
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,510
It's a long story.

74
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:23,722
I don't really want to go into all the whats
and whys and gory details right now...

75
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,226
but you should know we all still love Max.
To figure out what happened...

76
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,229
you'd have to dig up Freud
and have him work on me full-time.

77
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,773
- Honey, I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

78
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,568
So, I hope you didn't get too far
on that cake.

79
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,864
No, that's one thing
you can be thankful about.

80
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,783
You caught me in plenty of time.

81
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,577
Good. I know the kind of work
you were gonna put into it.

82
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,581
I would've killed myself if you'd
gone to all that craziness for nothing.

83
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,585
I've been so busy lately,
I actually forgot about it.

84
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,422
Listen, do me a favor. Mention canceling
the wedding to Miss Patty, will you?

85
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,049
That way, by the time we get back...

86
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,301
The whole town will know within the hour.

87
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:05,264
Hopefully, they will all have chatted it
out of their systems before we get home.

88
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,516
Consider it done. So where are you going?

89
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,310
- We have no idea.
- My favorite kind of trip.

90
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,022
Thanks. I'll talk to you soon.
Call the cell if you need anything.

91
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,275
- Okey-dokey. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

92
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,113
You were a good cake, Clyde.
I never should have named you.

93
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,576
That had better not be a map.

94
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,704
Sorry, but I'm openly defying
your no-map policy.

95
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,915
Mom, it's gonna be dark
in a couple of hours.

96
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,458
I don't want to sleep in the car.

97
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,461
My sense of adventure
did not translate to my offspring.

98
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,505
To the best of my map-reading abilities...

99
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,841
we're headed toward
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

100
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,467
- Portsmouth?
- What?

101
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:46,346
I actually have a friend in Portsmouth,
Donald something-or-other-stein.

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,848
Close, personal friend?

103
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:51,518
Donald moved there a couple of years ago
and opened a B & B.

104
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,188
No, it's actually
supposed to be pretty cool.

105
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,480
- A cool B & B?
- Yes.

106
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,983
That's like saying
'an understated Nicolas Cage movie. '

107
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,778
I myself am not usually a fan of B & B,
but Donald's place is different.

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,822
- Captain Corelli's Mandolin.
- I'm serious.

109
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,033
'Bella bambina at two o'clock!'

110
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,995
Every room is decorated in a different
weird style from a different century.

111
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,039
- That is kind of cool.
- Okay, let's go.

112
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,332
- Let's call.
- Let's go.

113
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,250
- Let's call.
- Sense of adventure.

114
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,543
Let's go.

115
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,887
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

116
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,473
- Would you like to ring the bell?
- What?

117
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,809
Would you like to ring the bell,
you or your daughter?

118
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,019
I don't understand.

119
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,313
I'm not usually sitting here
when guests arrive...

120
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,024
so people ring the bell,
and they love to ring the bell.

121
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,151
You didn't get to ring the bell.

122
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,612
Well done.

123
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,281
Do you have a room available?

124
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,450
We most certainly do,
you lucky, pretty things.

125
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,786
- See? They have a room.
- Good.

126
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,996
Does Donald happen to be here?

127
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,500
No, I bought this place from Donald
last year. It's my place now.

128
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,669
- I'm Ladawn.
- Hi.

129
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,339
Yes, I noticed it was a little different.
Actually, very different.

130
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,508
- Did you see it before?
- Pictures.

131
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,511
It was wacky, just like Donald.

132
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,181
It was fun, you know,
but just a little too...

133
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,683
It was just too eclectic.

134
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,561
I don't care for eclectic.
I don't think B & Bers do, either.

135
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,771
No, you wouldn't want anything
out of the normal.

136
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:21,692
Okay, Room Number 3 is all yours.
Welcome to The Cheshire Cat.

137
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,988
Nice name. I'm gonna consult
with my daughter for just one second.

138
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,660
- We must leave this place immediately.
- And sleep where?

139
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:35,539
- A hollow tree, a riverbank, I don't care.
- Mom, I'm tired and I'm starving.

140
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,709
She's named the place
after an Alice In Wonderland character.

141
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,588
- This is my worst nightmare.
- And dying of exposure in a jeep is mine.

142
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,965
Okay.

143
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,887
Point the way to Room 3.

144
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,765
I'll take you there myself.
Let me just grab your bags.

145
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,311
- We can do that.
- No, you are my guests.

146
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:01,190
I won't hear of it. There you go.

147
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,777
You want to ring the bell?
You haven't rung the bell.

148
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:08,530
- Maybe some other time.
- Follow me.

149
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,370
Watch out for Sammy.

150
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,877
That's either Sammy
or the cat that ate Sammy.

151
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,641
What is it, dear?

152
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,519
- There's just a lot...
- A lot of flowers.

153
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,604
- Like a ton of flowers.
- Plethora of flowers.

154
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,648
A load of flowers.

155
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,943
Thank you.
I get so many compliments on this room.

156
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,696
- Are they moving?
- It looks like it, doesn't it?

157
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,867
There's foil in the paper,
and it gives it that illusion. Isn't it terrific?

158
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,454
- Unbelievable.
- B & Bers love a peaceful setting...

159
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,040
so that they can unwind
from their hectic lives.

160
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,335
- What business are you in, dear?
- Me? Publishing.

161
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,796
How interesting!

162
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,758
If you need anything,
you just ring down or come down...

163
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,677
'cause I love company.

164
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,638
I didn't want to forget
to give you our activity list.

165
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,849
Never a dull moment around here.

166
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,184
- Thanks, Ladawn.
- Yes, thank you.

167
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,646
I think we just found the first room
in world history...

168
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,650
that would have made Liberace say,
'Whoa, step back. No one's that gay. '

169
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,363
Look. This is a book
that past guests have written in.

170
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,700
'This room made my soul soar. '

171
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:39,538
- All right, enough grossness. Let's go eat.
- Food. I'm starving.

172
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,795
- What?
- Dentists.

173
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,798
Boston dentists.
Cocktail hour at The Cheshire Cat.

174
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:51,717
- So?
- So our exit is blocked.

175
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,886
- Let's just rush past them.
- Too risky.

176
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,012
They're not assassins.

177
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,556
If they catch us,
they'll clamp on us like leeches.

178
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,975
And you know what that means: Chitchat.

179
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:03,562
Stomach-churning, mind-numbing,
soul-deadening chitchat.

180
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,982
Mom, I'm starving.
I'm going down there. You can stay here.

181
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,734
- You're that hungry?
- Yes.

182
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,694
Hungry enough
to answer a hundred probing...

183
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,280
but only slightly different
from each other questions...

184
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,867
about Chilton, life in a small town,
and your hunky boyfriend?

185
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,667
- I struck gold.
- What is it?

186
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,920
- Certs.
- Let me catch my breath.

187
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,381
I cannot, for the life of me,
remember the last time I bought Certs.

188
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,926
- Which would make those really old.
- Fuzzy.

189
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,850
- Perfect.
- A nice capper to the day.

190
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,979
In three hours, they've participated in
every inane B & B group activity known.

191
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,524
Let's just hope they finish
with a mass suicide.

192
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,067
We get cranky when we're hungry.

193
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,236
Plus, we're above everyone else
on the planet.

194
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,445
Clearly.

195
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,405
- So, what do you want to do?
- I don't know.

196
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,282
We could go to sleep.

197
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,618
- It's 8:23.
- Good Lord!

198
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,037
- I'm not really sleepy.
- Me, neither.

199
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,122
- We could sing.
- Sing?

200
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,125
We could sing Anarchy in the UK
at the top of our lungs.

201
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,920
That would be good. Or we could talk.

202
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,341
- What about?
- I don't know.

203
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,468
Max?

204
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,971
- No.
- Why?

205
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,806
Because I don't want to.

206
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,058
You said we could talk.

207
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,602
I thought you meant about makeup
or something.

208
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,895
When have we ever done that?

209
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,439
Never, that's why I thought
now would be a good time.

210
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,483
- I just need to know...
- Good night, Rory.

211
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,901
- But...
- Good night.

212
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,323
Are you sure that
you're not just running scared?

213
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,617
- Because I think you really love him...
- Enough!

214
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,495
...but you're just freaked out
and don't know what to do.

215
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,623
Because you did this before,
with Max, in fact.

216
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,625
Rory, I don't want to talk about this.

217
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,670
I thought by saying 'enough,'
and turning off the light...

218
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,547
you would get the message.
Apparently not.

219
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,340
The skywriter will be here in a minute.

220
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,467
- I'm asking you a question.
- I'm a grown woman.

221
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,636
Says the woman
with the Hello Kitty waffle iron.

222
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,640
I have the right not to be quizzed on
my social life by my 16-year-old daughter.

223
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,184
I thought I was your best friend.

224
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,188
At a U2 concert, you are.
But now, you're my 16-year-old daughter...

225
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,231
and I do not want to have
this conversation.

226
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,649
- I do.
- Well, tough.

227
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:16,236
Everything was planned.
Everyone was excited, including you.

228
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,281
- And then, all of a sudden, you're out.
- I changed my mind.

229
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:23,243
- This is our life that you just tossed off.
- I didn't just toss off anything.

230
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,829
We had plans.
We made space in the closet.

231
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,958
Just because we moved a couple of boxes
isn't reason enough for me to get married.

232
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,211
Max was counting on this.
I was counting on this.

233
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,339
Stop it! We're not gonna have this fight
in a flowery bedroom...

234
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,716
with dentists singing in the background!

235
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,260
- It's too David Lynch.
- I think you love him.

236
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:43,388
- Rory, go to sleep!
- You love him, and you got scared...

237
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,225
and you ran, but you're really
going to regret it, and soon.

238
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,352
Fine!

239
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:50,604
Good night.

240
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,868
I'm sure.

241
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,915
I wish I did love him.

242
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,545
You have no idea how much.

243
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,731
- What's with the face?
- They're taller.

244
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,192
- Not this again.
- There's more of them.

245
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:41,238
Mom, the flowers on the wallpaper
are not growing or reproducing.

246
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,909
Wait, you weren't writing in this thing,
were you?

247
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,786
Maybe some random thoughts.

248
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,208
- 'Satanic forces are at work here. ' Mom.
- What?

249
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,502
What? We cannot write that in here.

250
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,421
Here.

251
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,133
'Sat and forever am at work here. '

252
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,093
That doesn't make any sense.

253
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:05,596
It doesn't invoke the Dark Prince,
so it's preferable.

254
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,805
Whatever.

255
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,265
- Hey.
- What?

256
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,434
- Last night.
- We're good.

257
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:11,727
Okay.

258
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,187
- You know what isn't good?
- What?

259
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,855
- I ate the fuzzy Certs.
- Gross.

260
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,483
- They tasted like keys.
- Okay, enough. I have got to eat.

261
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:22,446
- You think the coast is clear downstairs?
- Let's check the schedule.

262
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,992
'Early morning nature walk: 7:30,
regional history talk: 8:15... '

263
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,204
We're in luck. Breakfast just ended.

264
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:32,664
The arts-and-crafts workshop
begins in 13 minutes.

265
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:34,541
- A window.
- Must be when they shower.

266
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,001
Grab your bag!

267
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,004
Go.

268
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,430
Hello, strangers.

269
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:52,434
We've all been so worried about you two.

270
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,689
- What are you people doing?
- We're watching hummingbirds.

271
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,983
They're still out there,
if you want to scooch in.

272
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,360
They're the darnedest things.

273
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,655
Flap their wings 100 times a second.
It's an engineering marvel.

274
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,281
That was not on the freaking list.

275
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,700
We don't put things like this
on the freaking list...

276
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,829
because the delights of nature
aren't on any time schedule.

277
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,038
Lordy.

278
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,999
So push in some chairs.
We're gonna make some fresh scones.

279
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,128
They're for tea this afternoon. I just
put out the first test batch. Have a taste.

280
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:23,382
- A taste would not be bad.
- Maybe just a quick taste.

281
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,429
So, Ladawn says you're in publishing.

282
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,349
Publishing? You're in publishing?

283
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,226
- Yes, I am.
- Books?

284
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,562
You should find a field
with less paperwork.

285
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:37,855
Good one.

286
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,649
You have two. I still have one.

287
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,192
So, publishing?

288
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,236
Yes, I do publish.

289
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,406
Kind of a dry line of work,
not much to talk about.

290
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,575
Nonsense. It's fascinating.

291
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,077
What kind of books do you publish?

292
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,080
Mainly youth-oriented ones.

293
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,915
- Children's books?
- Sure.

294
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,126
- Any that we've heard of?
- Probably not.

295
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,629
No, wait, please give me some titles.
I'll write them down.

296
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,923
And then when I get home,
I'll look them up.

297
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,301
- Do you have your Space Pen?
- Do you have to ask?

298
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,678
- He loves his Space Pen.
- They write underwater.

299
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,097
- Cool.
- What are the titles?

300
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,976
There's Goodnight Spoon...

301
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,770
and The Horse That Wanted To Bark.

302
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,231
I think I've read that to my grandson.

303
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,942
The horse learns to bark, and then he...

304
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,861
What happens at the end?

305
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,154
He dies.

306
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:32,242
But he learned to bark, though,
so it's actually an upper.

307
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:36,788
- So, where are your offices?
- They're in the...

308
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,918
The building with the... Over on the road.

309
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,128
Would you guys excuse me
for just a second?

310
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,797
I have to make an important call
concerning publishing.

311
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:49,218
Fine, that'll give us a chance
to get to know your lovely daughter.

312
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,346
She's so quiet, but we'll change all that.

313
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,767
Mom, you promised not to do
any business while on vacation.

314
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,979
Honey, publishing waits for no man.
Got to keep the presses pressing.

315
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,901
Tell us about your school.

316
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,947
Hey, Sookie, it's me.

317
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:13,617
- Hey, sweetie, how's the trip going?
- It's fine. Where are you?

318
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,203
Luke's got a nice little show going on here.

319
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:19,373
- You've been sitting there for two hours.
- I want one more coffee.

320
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,707
You've had eight refills.

321
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:24,628
In France, when you sit and order, you can
have the table as long as you want it.

322
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:27,965
- I bet you know what I'm gonna say next.
- That we're not in France?

323
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,716
Give or take a profanity.

324
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,135
Fine, I'll go. Can I have my check?

325
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,974
How's the spreading of the news going?

326
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,852
It worked just like you wanted,
with one notable exception.

327
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:40,936
Who? What?

328
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,772
He's such a loner lately,
the news hasn't gotten to him.

329
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,274
Is there any way to speed this up?

330
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,986
Sorry, I'm figuring out the tip,
and I've always been terrible at Math.

331
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,779
What's 6% of $4.43?

332
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:55,409
Could you just tell him now,
so I can cross this off my list?

333
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,328
He's coming over. Hang on.

334
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,624
Have you heard the latest news?

335
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,586
- Kind of sad, Lorelai and Max.
- What about them?

336
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,380
- The wedding's off.
- What? What happened?

337
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,258
I don't really know. It was kind of sudden.

338
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:15,762
- This is actually her now.
- Tell her I'm sorry. That's tough.

339
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,806
- He says he's sorry.
- Thanks.

340
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:20,392
- Talk to you later. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

341
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,105
- What's this?
- Refill number 9.

342
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,523
I thought you said I had to go.

343
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:27,900
- You can hang a bit.
- Really?

344
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,819
Welcome to France.
Coffee's on the house, though.

345
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:33,071
Thanks, or should I say gracias?

346
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:36,241
In fact, everyone's coffee
is on the house today.

347
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:39,536
- Like your hat.
- Thank you.

348
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,498
We have a son just a bit older than you.

349
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:46,418
- He's not good enough for her.
- He's a freshman at Brown.

350
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,129
- He majors in MTV.
- You're horrible.

351
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,382
Honey, we don't even know
if she's on the market.

352
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:55,302
I'm not on the market.
I'm definitely off the market.

353
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:58,013
- She has a boyfriend.
- Isn't that cute?

354
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,141
Mom, I saved you a scone.
You love me, right?

355
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:04,228
Sorry, everybody,
I'm gonna have to drag her away now.

356
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:08,482
- It was so nice talking to you.
- Lovely talking to you, dear.

357
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,526
She's so cute.

358
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,237
- I now have abandonment issues.
- I had to make a call.

359
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,821
- You left me hanging.
- I owe you one.

360
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,866
- Bigtime.
- You're out now. What do you want to do?

361
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,951
- Kill you.
- And?

362
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,620
- I don't know.
- Bounce tennis balls off of Sammy?

363
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,455
- Seriously?
- I'm not sure.

364
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:26,959
- Pull out the map you're hiding.
- I'm not hiding a map.

365
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,963
I didn't wanna
drive around aimlessly again today.

366
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,297
I got it.

367
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,299
What's near?

368
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,347
- Concord.
- What is that? Like, look at grapes?

369
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,599
- Manchester.
- Been there, done that.

370
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:45,227
- You've never been there.
- I feel like I have.

371
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,271
- Salem.
- Witches and stonings.

372
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,773
- There's something there.
- Boston, Newton, Needham.

373
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,818
- Go back.
- What? Boston? Newton?

374
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:56,321
- I know where we're going.
- Where are we going?

375
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,282
You will love it.

376
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:02,494
If you tell me where we're going,
I can chart a course, and I can...

377
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,371
You're folding it wrong.

378
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,914
- Is it smaller?
- Yes.

379
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,208
Then it's not wrong. Let's go.

380
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,047
I will get you a new one
when we get there.

381
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,883
Where are we going?

382
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:24,641
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it, because there it is.

383
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,019
- Harvard University.
- It's really real.

384
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,771
- It looks just like the pictures.
- It's beautiful.

385
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:33,317
- What are we doing here?
- We are beholding your future.

386
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,777
- It's big.
- You have a big future.

387
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,989
I can't believe it.
I'm actually standing outside of Harvard.

388
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,949
- Come on.
- Wait, come where?

389
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,868
- Inside.
- We can't go inside.

390
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,703
Why? Is there a force field around here?

391
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:46,288
- This is Harvard.
- I know.

392
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,001
You can't just go inside. You need a guide.

393
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,252
I'll be your guide.

394
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:56,548
- What do you know about Harvard?
- I know this: Look, there's Harvard.

395
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:58,884
Don't you want to see it?

396
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,512
The place where you'll be living
and studying...

397
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,181
and developing very naive
but pretentious world views...

398
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,600
that will come crashing down
the minute you graduate?

399
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,894
- Yeah, I do.
- So?

400
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,483
Come on, you know you want to.
All the other kids are doing it.

401
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,954
- Harvard is over 300 years old.
- Founded in 1636.

402
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,040
That means almost everyone
who ever went to Harvard is dead now.

403
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:32,334
- You sure you still wanna go here?
- Yes, I'm sure.

404
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:35,671
They developed the pacemaker here.

405
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,465
Also discovered how electromagnetism
and radioactivity...

406
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,384
are two manifestations
of the same force...

407
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,594
and postulated existence
of a charmed quark.

408
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:45,222
- I was wondering who did that.
- The smarties at Harvard.

409
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,682
Holy smokes.

410
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,602
They get an average of 18,000 applicants
every year, and only 2,000 get in.

411
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,187
- Those are not good odds.
- Mom.

412
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,730
No, you're different.

413
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,900
'Past graduates: Henry James. '
Isn't that a beer?

414
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,903
- And a novelist. Go on.
- 'John Adams. ' That's a beer.

415
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:02,447
Our second President.
He's very in right now.

416
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:05,242
'W.E.B. DuBois, Yo-Yo Ma. '

417
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,619
- Cool! Fred Gwynne.
- Who?

418
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:10,122
Herman Munster. Now I'm impressed.

419
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,708
- Want something?
- A nice, cool Henry James.

420
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,126
- Or some coffee?
- Or some coffee.

421
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,461
I'm ordering coffee at Harvard.

422
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,758
There's people looking for roommates,
tons of them.

423
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,803
'Wanted: Girl to share
a two-bedroom apartment on Trowbridge.

424
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:28,015
'Quiet street, quiet building,
so quiet roomie a must. '

425
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:31,018
Join a convent and cloister yourself,
you loser.

426
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,979
Mom, it's gonna be two years
before I go to Harvard.

427
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:36,815
These people will have roommates
or have graduated by then.

428
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:37,983
Who says these are for you?

429
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,359
- Who are they for?
- Me.

430
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:42,154
If you're here, I'd need a room nearby
so I can come visit.

431
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:45,991
- How often are you gonna visit?
- I don't know. Every other day.

432
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,076
Too much? What's too much?

433
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,752
- Man, there are a lot of postings here.
- Yeah, there sure are.

434
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,670
Are you looking for a place to live?

435
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,756
- Maybe.
- There's a lot of choices.

436
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:02,716
Something for everybody.

437
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:06,386
Unless you're an existentialist
and can't figure out what you want.

438
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,846
Good point.

439
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,433
I think we have a class together.
Contract Law. Prof. Shefferson?

440
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,477
- Yeah, Sheff's class.
- Right.

441
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,980
- I've been meaning to say hi to you.
- Really? Hi.

442
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,692
So, do you like the class?

443
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,695
- It's not too bad.
- He's kind of got a monotone voice.

444
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,991
- If I don't caff up, he puts me to sleep.
- I'm caffing up now, just for the hell of it.

445
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:31,829
Okay. So I'll see you in class,
and maybe at that Phi Kap party tonight?

446
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,913
Peachy.

447
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,873
- Cool. Bye.
- Bye.

448
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,378
I think I'm gonna like college.

449
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,047
- I used 'existentialist' in a sentence.
- I heard.

450
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,217
- I've always wanted to do that.
- It was very impressive.

451
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,556
Oh, my!

452
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,059
- What's this?
- It's the library.

453
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,771
It's the biggest library I've ever seen.

454
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,273
- Brace yourself.
- What?

455
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,609
- This is just one of the libraries.
- One of the libraries?

456
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:06,405
'This building is one component
of a 13 million-volume collection...

457
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,532
'housed in more than
90 different libraries.

458
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:13,245
'It's the oldest library in the US, and
the largest academic library in the world. '

459
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,873
- Breathe.
- I'm a failure.

460
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,666
- What?
- I am stupid.

461
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,419
- Stop.
- I'm uninformed, ignorant, and...

462
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,839
I can't even think of a second synonym
for 'uninformed. '

463
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,424
- I suck.
- Honey.

464
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,634
Thirteen million volumes?

465
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:31,597
I've read 300 books in my entire life,
and I'm already 16?

466
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,224
You know how long I would need
to read 13 million books?

467
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,895
You don't have to read every one of them.
Tuesdays With Morrie. Skip that.

468
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,980
Who Moved My Cheese?
Stuff you already know.

469
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,900
But every kid coming to Harvard
is inevitably reading books.

470
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,778
Different books. I want to be able to
converse intelligently with each of them.

471
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,822
I can't do that unless I read books.

472
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,908
At least a few
from every genre and subgenre.

473
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,576
Come on, I'm getting you out of here.

474
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,869
- I sleep too much.
- You don't.

475
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,371
- I've been frittering away my life.
- You don't fritter.

476
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,623
- Did I mention I suck?
- Yes.

477
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,291
- Well, I do.
- No.

478
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,130
This is a dorm? Not bad.

479
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:08,759
- Pretty, actually.
- Let's see what it looks like on the inside.

480
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,678
It says 'residents only' in plain English.

481
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,307
We're gonna get in trouble.

482
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:17,809
You're such a worrywart. Get in character.

483
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,603
- Hey, there!
- Hi.

484
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,647
I'm Angie. This is Trish.

485
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,608
- How's it going?
- Not bad.

486
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,653
Cool. We're just kind of hanging out
between classes.

487
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,196
We got Sheff next.

488
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,241
So, we'll probably see you
at the Phi Alpha Beta thing tomorrow?

489
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,367
Maybe.

490
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,662
Yeah, we're not sure, either.
They can be so totally lame.

491
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,164
- Gag me.
- Yeah. See you.

492
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,960
You do realize your college kid jargon...

493
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:45,754
comes from Happy Days
and the Valley Girl song.

494
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,298
- Looky-looky here.
- What are you doing?

495
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,092
I wanna see a room. Hello?

496
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,427
They have pictures of their rooms
on their website.

497
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,137
I prefer reality, thank you.

498
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:56,223
Hello? The coast is clear.

499
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,600
- The coast is not clear.
- Susie!

500
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,604
We're now officially breaking and entering.
Why are you saying that?

501
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:04,064
It's our cover if we get caught.

502
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:08,277
Plus, there's a 30% chance
the girl living in this room is named Susie.

503
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,487
- Tiny.
- It is tiny.

504
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:13,282
Your Oxford English Dictionary
will need a room of its own.

505
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,326
- It'll fit somewhere.
- One window, brick wall.

506
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,580
- You'll need a better view.
- This isn't my room, to begin with.

507
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:23,167
At least there's two beds,
somewhere for me to sleep.

508
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,711
- That'd be my roommate's bed.
- You don't want a roomie.

509
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,046
- I don't have a choice.
- They force someone on you?

510
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,048
It's all part of the socializing experience.

511
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:31,967
- If it's a lemon?
- Then I'm stuck with it.

512
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,595
- Hare Krishna banging a tambourine.
- I'll use earplugs.

513
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:37,514
- Serial murderer.
- I'll sleep with a gat strapped to my ankle.

514
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:40,058
- Someone who likes Linkin Park?
- Then I'll drop out.

515
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,520
Look, I had these same pants
in high school!

516
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,480
- Can we go now, please?
- I'm in again.

517
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:46,648
- Mom.
- Okay.

518
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:48,650
Let me take a picture with you at the desk.

519
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,027
- What?
- Really get into it.

520
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,738
- Pretend like you're studying.
- Okay.

521
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:56,658
What, you're writing in the air?

522
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:59,244
- Can we just take the picture?
- Okay.

523
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,121
Let's go.

524
00:27:03,874 --> 00:27:05,250
Hey, Susie.

525
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,475
- God, these classrooms are huge.
- The better to fit those big Harvard brains.

526
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:28,857
'Mortal have you been born,
to mortals have you given birth.

527
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:30,776
'Reckon on everything,
expect everything. '

528
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:33,695
- What sort of thought is this?
- Depressing?

529
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,618
On the surface, maybe. But go underneath.
What is he postulating beyond fatalism?

530
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,912
- Are we allowed to be hearing this?
- I don't know.

531
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,915
They won't charge $100
just for listening to part of the class?

532
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:48,794
I don't think Harvard would
nickel-and-dime people like that.

533
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,337
I'm gonna find the ladies' room.

534
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,923
Sneak a smoke, see if anyone
slipped aspirin in my Coke.

535
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:55,884
Okay, Rizzo.
I'd like to listen a little bit more.

536
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,803
- I'll be back.
- I'll be here.

537
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:02,599
The Stoics believed the greatest happiness
resulted from leading a virtuous life.

538
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:06,436
- In or out?
- Excuse me?

539
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:09,690
If you're going to take the class,
you have to take a seat.

540
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,359
Okay, sorry.

541
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:17,990
Okay, where were we?

542
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:00,949
That's an interesting point,
but I'm not sure I agree with you.

543
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:04,077
That's because Stoicism
was not about giving up things...

544
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,705
- of money and luxuries and stuff.
- That's right.

545
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,540
By the time he was in his early 40s...

546
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:11,126
Seneca had earned enough money
to acquire villas, farms.

547
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,004
He ate well. He loved expensive furniture.

548
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:17,049
But he didn't consider that
a non-philosophical way to live.

549
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,884
It's all kind of relative, though.

550
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,594
- Here we go.
- What?

551
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,096
Can't get through a class
without debating relativism.

552
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,308
I just meant luxury to some
is not necessarily luxury to others.

553
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,061
- A better subject for another time.
- Sorry.

554
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:32,397
No, your point is well-taken,
but it's different than what's at hand.

555
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,150
What we're talking about
is Seneca's choosing the better...

556
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:38,820
more comfortable of two options
while remaining a Stoic.

557
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:43,033
- Thanks, this was fun.
- All right, for your next meeting...

558
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,994
we'll be reading
Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.

559
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,454
- Did you see me?
- Yes.

560
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:49,248
- I was in college.
- It was amazing.

561
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:52,084
- Did I look like I belonged?
- Completely. You're a natural.

562
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,920
I can't even believe how it happened.
I just got swept up.

563
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,297
The teacher asked a question,
and before I knew it...

564
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:59,925
- You were blowing them away.
- I don't know about that...

565
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,095
- but I was talking and I couldn't stop.
- I know that feeling.

566
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,223
College is gonna be amazing. I can't wait.

567
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,935
I love college. I love Harvard.
I love fatalism.

568
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,781
Please, we can carry the bags.

569
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,908
- Nonsense.
- But they're so heavy.

570
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:27,870
I'll just get them down the stairs for you.

571
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:30,080
Let me catch my breath here.

572
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:32,583
Sammy's AWOL?

573
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,170
Sammy. It's the first time
she hasn't been on the stairs.

574
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:37,337
- My Sammy?
- Yes.

575
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:40,465
- She's rarely ever on the stairs.
- No, she's always right there.

576
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:43,218
No, she has her favorite place,
but not on the stairs.

577
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:46,096
There's not been one moment
she hasn't been right there.

578
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:49,516
On the stairs?
No, she's hardly ever on the stairs.

579
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,935
'Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown. '

580
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,985
Everything's on your card.
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

581
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,945
- Did you enjoy your stay?
- Very much.

582
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,071
Very much?

583
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:05,949
- I sat and forever am at work here.
- What?

584
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:09,077
- It was great.
- There you go.

585
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,664
Drive safely and tell all your friends
about The Cheshire Cat.

586
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:13,874
You bet we will.

587
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:16,919
- Now I'll do my favorite part of the job.
- What's that?

588
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:19,630
Read what you wrote in our guest book.

589
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:21,256
Give us a five-minute head start?

590
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,217
- Beg pardon?
- Thank you.

591
00:31:34,353 --> 00:31:36,980
- Know what I love most about Harvard?
- No, what?

592
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,941
They don't sell giant foam fingers.

593
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,485
No, they've got class out the wazoo.

594
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:44,822
- Home.
- Feel like we've been gone a long time.

595
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:48,116
It's weird. Every time I leave town,
even for just a little while...

596
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,661
I always expect
everything to look different.

597
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:53,205
- And it never does.
- It never does.

598
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,844
Need a hug?

599
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,805
Patty's good.

600
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:22,568
So, what about dinner?

601
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:25,487
It should be something healthy,
since we've been eating junk.

602
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,698
We had lettuce on our burgers last night.

603
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,741
- We picked it off.
- But it left its essence.

604
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:32,077
- Lettuce essence on our burgers?
- Definitely.

605
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,705
- That satisfied our vegetable requirement?
- For the week.

606
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,374
We can't argue with cold, hard facts.

607
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:40,460
What?

608
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,715
- I forgot about that.
- Me, too.

609
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,428
Everything's the same.

610
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,678
This is Sever Hall,
one of the oldest buildings at Harvard.

611
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,764
- Focus the picture, Lorelai.
- It is focused.

612
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:35,933
- That's how it came out.
- It's hurting my eyes.

613
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:39,311
- Just be a little arty.
- She doesn't know how to use a camera.

614
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:42,898
- I've only had it six years.
- It's like I have glaucoma.

615
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:45,108
What's that?

616
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,736
- That is a Harvard squirrel.
- Good grief.

617
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,946
Sitting on a Harvard rock.

618
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,032
- Doesn't he look smart?
- He looks dirty. Next.

619
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:56,119
- That's Rory's dorm and part of my finger.
- It's not my dorm yet.

620
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:58,121
We saw a dorm
and figured it might be mine.

621
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:01,500
- Why do you insist on taking slides?
- I like slides.

622
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:04,169
But prints are so much easier
and faster to get through.

623
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:06,213
That's what I hate about prints.

624
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:09,299
You give people this big pile of pictures
you're so proud of.

625
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:12,177
They flip through them fast
without really seeing them...

626
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,513
or letting you narrate,
like you can with slides.

627
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:17,516
- I stopped her from adding music.
- I'm eternally grateful.

628
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:20,894
I like the bigness of slides, too.
Makes you feel like you're there.

629
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:24,273
This one makes me feel
just like I'm in your finger.

630
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,860
You're just jealous
'cause we didn't invite you along.

631
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:28,944
Next time.

632
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,321
Next time you go,
you're going to do it properly...

633
00:34:31,363 --> 00:34:34,366
- with a scheduled visit and guide.
- I told her about the guide.

634
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,493
Why go out of town
so soon before your wedding?

635
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,537
Didn't your fianc� mind?

636
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,209
You act as if this coming weekend
is just business as usual...

637
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,211
and not the most important day
of your life.

638
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:47,337
Mom.

639
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:50,757
What?

640
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:53,886
- It's about this weekend, Mom.
- Yes?

641
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,931
I should have told you before.

642
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:00,017
Oh, my God. You didn't.

643
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,394
- What?
- You did!

644
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:04,438
- I did what?
- You eloped.

645
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:07,566
I knew you'd do anything
to keep me out of this wedding.

646
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:10,527
- Mom, that's not...
- That is just cruel, Lorelai.

647
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,113
A mother waits and plans for this day,
even your mother.

648
00:35:13,197 --> 00:35:14,781
- Yes, but...
- I bought a new dress.

649
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:16,283
- Got my hair done.
- It looks nice.

650
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:19,036
And you just waltz in here,
torture me for hours...

651
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:22,372
with these ridiculous slides,
only to let me know at the last minute...

652
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:26,168
Mom, Max and I are not together anymore.
The wedding is off.

653
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:30,005
- The wedding's off?
- Yes.

654
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,883
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

655
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:40,390
- Who called it off?
- I did.

656
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:47,523
You're thinking you're not surprised.

657
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,317
No, I wasn't.

658
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,445
You're thinking,
'Yes, I won that $5 from Dad. '

659
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:57,783
- Who would like dessert?
- What are you thinking? Just tell me.

660
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:02,371
I was thinking,
I guess I have to return your gift.

661
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,582
- My gift?
- That's right.

662
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:09,211
You'll have to return my gift.
That's what you were thinking?

663
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,587
That's right.

664
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,506
- That's it?
- That's it.

665
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,805
So you got me a gift already?

666
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:23,600
You were getting married. Gifts are
expected. It's the proper thing to do.

667
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:26,436
- So, how does ice cream sound?
- Ice cream sounds great.

668
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,856
- What'd you get me, Mom?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

669
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,941
- Why? It's for me.
- You're not getting it now.

670
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:32,693
Iced tea spoons, right?

671
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:35,404
Because nobody really needs
iced tea spoons ever.

672
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,364
You'd probably use them
if you remembered...

673
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:40,450
but nobody does. They're never
with the everyday silverware.

674
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:42,327
Out of sight, out of mind.

675
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:45,038
So people just grab
a regular everyday spoon to stir.

676
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:48,500
- And you know what? They work fine.
- It wasn't iced tea spoons.

677
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:51,295
Corn-on-the-cob holder thingies?

678
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:54,047
- Sterling silver corn-on-the-cob holders?
- No.

679
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:55,632
What?

680
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:58,010
- The tiny forks.
- What tiny forks?

681
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:01,847
The ones with tiny prongs and handles,
that I assume are used to eat tiny food?

682
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,975
- They're for lobster tails.
- So you did get the tiny forks.

683
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:08,854
You know what? I'm not returning the gift.
I'm going to put it away.

684
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,190
You won't know what it is
until you do get married.

685
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,316
- Tell me now.
- Sorry.

686
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:15,527
I may never get married.
I may be a free spirit my whole life...

687
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:18,655
or fall for a separated Catholic guy
like Katherine Hepburn did...

688
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,741
and not get to go to his funeral
when he dies.

689
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,993
- Then you'll never know what I got.
- I must know.

690
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:24,203
- No.
- This is torture.

691
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:26,288
- Tough.
- Okay, fine. Forget it.

692
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:29,791
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- I'm going to the kitchen.

693
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:36,048
- Oh, God. You scared me.
- Come on, tell me.

694
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,883
- Lorelai, get away.
- Tell me now.

695
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:39,718
- I'm serious, get away.
- Please tell me.

696
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,886
This is not funny.

697
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,474
- Am I too far from the curb?
- You're within 5 feet.

698
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:47,100
- Close enough for jazz.
- What?

699
00:37:47,184 --> 00:37:48,685
- Look it up?
- You got it.

700
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:52,314
- Oh, my God. Lane!
- I'm back!

701
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:53,357
I see.

702
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,527
- Did you ever think this day would come?
- I had hopes, dreams.

703
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,238
I escaped from Korea. I'm home.
Hi, Lorelai.

704
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:01,698
- Welcome home, sweetie.
- It's so amazing to be back.

705
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,742
When I got off the plane,
I kissed the tarmac.

706
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:05,911
- Like the Pope.
- It was hot, I burned my lips.

707
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:07,746
That's why the Pope always looks grumpy.

708
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,248
- I'm back.
- I know.

709
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,875
- Did you get my letters?
- The first one was intense.

710
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,919
- Which one was that?
- The one that said:

711
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:16,880
'Korea equals death,'
with a bunch of exclamation points...

712
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:20,926
- and your sad face plastered all over it.
- That was a tad dramatic.

713
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,719
- Was it awful?
- It wasn't.

714
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,596
- Really?
- Some of it was great.

715
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,681
No way.

716
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:29,601
The food's not so bad, and then my
cousins were actually pretty interesting.

717
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:32,271
And the best part,
Korea is bootleg heaven.

718
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,772
I totally scored in Seoul.

719
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:36,900
Elvis Costello at the Marquee in 1978...

720
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:40,320
a barely coherent
Nico doing Doors songs in 1974...

721
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:41,905
and an even more barely coherent...

722
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,950
Iggy Pop doing David Bowie songs naked
in 1981.

723
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:46,660
How did you get them past customs?

724
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,246
I strapped them to my body,
like in Midnight Express.

725
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,373
- Cool.
- I'll be in Luke's.

726
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,921
- It was just an open-ended plane ticket?
- Just to save money. I kind of overreacted.

727
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,631
Kind of? You did everything...

728
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:02,259
but drown yourself
tied to the Statue of Liberty.

729
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:08,974
- Lewis and Clark have returned.
- Which one are you?

730
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:11,977
I don't know.
Which one had to paddle the canoe?

731
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,438
- Coffee?
- You have to ask?

732
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:19,276
Sorry about what happened, the wedding...

733
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,988
It's okay.
I'm fine. I want everyone to know that.

734
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:26,658
- I've been feeling like a jerk.
- Why?

735
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,162
The way I had to come down on Max,
I don't know. I was being a...

736
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,706
What's that word you use?
'Pickle-schnitz'?

737
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:34,917
- Schnickelfritz?
- Yeah, that's it.

738
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,127
Luke, it's okay. You already apologized.

739
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:39,755
- I've been feeling kind of guilty.
- Don't.

740
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,673
You are great, Luke.

741
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:44,426
Just making me that chuppah alone...

742
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:48,972
The chuppah.
I left that stupid chuppah on your lawn.

743
00:39:49,056 --> 00:39:50,390
- It's okay.
- What an idiot.

744
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:51,975
Really, it's okay.

745
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:55,354
This enormous reminder
sitting on your lawn, mocking you.

746
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:56,772
I didn't see it mock, I promise.

747
00:39:56,855 --> 00:40:01,068
I'll take it down in the morning. No,
I'll take it down now. We're closing early.

748
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,194
Chew it or lose it.

749
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:04,613
Luke, it's okay, really.

750
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,700
I think I'm gonna keep it.

751
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:10,202
- What?
- Yeah.

752
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:13,038
It's beautiful.
You made it for me, and it doesn't...

753
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,584
have to be a wedding chuppah.
It can be a beautiful archway in our yard.

754
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:20,337
- I'll grow stuff on it.
- Well, okay.

755
00:40:21,547 --> 00:40:24,633
I'll help you move it around the yard,
wherever you want it to be.

756
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:25,926
That would be good.

757
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,388
So, where'd you guys go?

758
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:31,098
We drove around a little...

759
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:35,394
- hit a B & B, and took a tour of Harvard.
- Harvard?

760
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:37,896
- Interesting.
- It was amazing.

761
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:41,650
Seeing Rory there, in a dorm room,
in a classroom...

762
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:44,653
- She fit.
- I can see her fitting there.

763
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:46,488
She was right at home.

764
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,949
So, how are you taking that?

765
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,451
- Taking what?
- Seeing her fit.

766
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,537
I loved it...

767
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,041
- and I hated it.
- That seems about right.

768
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,252
Man, these past few days...

769
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:04,715
So many thoughts about my life then...

770
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,884
my life now, what I missed.

771
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,761
Thoughts about what I'll never have...

772
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:13,432
- and what I want to have.
- That's a lot of thoughts.

773
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:16,185
You're not kidding.
So, can I ask you a question?

774
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:19,897
- Ever set up a line of credit at a bank?
- No.

775
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:22,232
You don't pay for everything
with cash on hand?

776
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:23,901
What's all this about?

777
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:26,904
- I think it's time to make a move.
- Meaning?

778
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:30,157
I'm diving in. Sookie and I
are finally gonna open that inn.

779
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,493
- Yeah, I know.
- No, I mean now.

780
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:35,954
We've been talking and dreaming about it.
It's time to get going on it.

781
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,499
- Well, if the time is right...
- It is.

782
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:41,210
You think I can hack
being a business owner?

783
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:43,378
- I think you can hack anything.
- Really?

784
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:46,298
Yeah, you know
all the creative stuff to the job...

785
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:49,384
you can manage,
and I've seen you try to add numbers...

786
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:51,595
so I'd get an accountant, first thing.

787
00:41:51,637 --> 00:41:53,680
- Okay, yes.
- How far along are you?

788
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:55,766
- This far.
- Well, listen...

789
00:41:56,475 --> 00:42:01,104
I'm no financial genius,
but we can sit down sometime.

790
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:04,942
You can pick my brain
on the few things I do know about.

791
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:06,610
- Really?
- I've been around some.

792
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,111
Can I ask you stupid questions?

793
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:11,073
- There is no such thing.
- How does ink come out of pens?

794
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:13,492
All right, there is such a thing.

795
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:16,829
But you're going to avoid that
when we sit down, right?

796
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:23,377
Thank you.

797
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:27,631
Let me know when you need help with
the thing that's not a chuppah anymore.

798
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:29,007
I will.

799
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:39,226
Fill me in. What've you been up to?
I must know everything.

800
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:43,146
- I've been to Harvard.
- No way. Oh, my God! How? When?

801
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:46,233
We just got back.
Mom, is it okay if I go to Lane's for a bit?

802
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:49,361
Yeah. I'll meet you back at the house.

803
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:52,698
Harvard? That is so cool.
What did you see?

804
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:56,285
Harvard Yard, classrooms,
where I might live next year.

805
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:57,953
- How was it?
- Needs a spruce.

806
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,371
I'll help you spruce.

807
00:43:10,382 --> 00:43:12,759
Sookie, hey, it's me. We're back.

808
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:15,846
It was good, but first things first.

809
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:18,765
I want to start moving on the inn thing.

810
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:23,187
I mean, take serious steps.
We're ready, don't you think?

811
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:27,399
Oh, good.
Meet me early at work tomorrow.
